                "abstract": "ABSTRACT Repetitive wrist movements are a common part of rehabilitation therapy, which can be boring and demotivate patients. In order to overcome this difficulty, we suggest an Arduino-based rehabilitation game that is modeled after the well-known \"Flappy Bird\" game. To improve patient participation during therapy, the system incorporates wrist movement exercises with gamification.The game converts wrist movements into gaming actions using an Arduino-based system and a wrist-controlled input device, like an accelerometer or flex sensor. The player controls the character's movement in the game by tilting or flexing their wrist, which promotes accurate and regular movements. In addition to helping with wrist mobility rehabilitation, this configuration offers real-time performance feedback, guaranteeing that therapeutic activities are carried out appropriately.Based on initial testing, gamification of wrist rehabilitation appears to enhance patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment regimens, and user motivation. The system offers a personalized, affordable, and entertaining way to do physical therapy, especially for people recovering from surgery or injuries to the wrist. Data tracking and adjustable difficulty levels might be included in later iterations to improve therapeutic results even more. The device offers a fun and engaging experience while encouraging patients to use precise and regulated wrist movements as part of their treatment routine. The level of the game can be changed to meet the demands of each individual receiving therapy, guaranteeing steady improvement and lowering the possibility of overdoing it. in addition to making therapy more pleasurable, this method encourages consistency, enhances adherence, and provides real-time progress tracking. This low-cost, portable, and configurable rehabilitation tool may find use in tete-rehabilitation settings, residences, and clinics. To further expand its use cases in physiotherapy, future developments might incorporate data analytics, cloud body parts.",

An optimal control method is developed on the basis of tlie Pontryagin maximum principle in order to successfully regulate the extent to which game addiction is propagated. Taking into consideration the education of families, a new dynamic model of the addiction that teens have to playing online games is built in order to investigate the most effective method for preventing the development of game addiction. To begin, we do a qualitative version of the dynamic analysis of the model. Among the topics that we investigate are the nonnegativity and boundedness of solutions, the fundamental reproduction number Ro, the presence of equilibria, and their stability. Then, we take into consideration a model that includes control measures of family education, isolation, and treatment, and we acquire the expression of optimal control. It is possible to explore the influence of tine delays and the conditions that are suitable for the actuality of Hopf bifurcation by employing the viable combinations of the delays as a bifurcation constraint throughout the investigation. The exhaustion of center manifold theory also leads to the acquisition of specific formulas for determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the permanence of the bifurcating periodic choices. With the help of the MATLAB software program, a few numerical replications are carried out in order to provide a directive to interpretation for the approval of theoretical findings. In conclusion, this is done in order to provide a directive to interpretation.",

The game features a hierarchical level structure, where the levels start from easier algorithms to complex ones, facilitating incremental learning. Each and every level has unique challenges and quizzes with specific algorithms that encourage the player's understanding and engagement through interactive gameplay. As players complete tasks, relevant code snippets are dynamically displayed, reinforcing the connection between theoretical concepts and practical application. This innovative approach helps players understand algorithmic principles better by using 3D visuals, making complex ideas easier to grasp. By bringing players into a visual environment, the player experiences the visual concept of a game rather than traditional learning methods. This improves the educational outcomes in the field of computer science. This educational tool aims to foster a deeper understanding of algorithms, ultimately enhancing the skill set of future programmers.",

One of the primary challenges that service providers face especially during the intake session and further while providing therapeutic interventions for children suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the difficulty to build rapport with the child because the child is facing a varied spectrum of emotions like confusion, guilt, fear, embarrassment etc. This further leads to them closing up to the therapist/ social worker due to their lack of trust. Our videogame would replace the first few interactions with the therapist and help them ease into therapy. The videogame experience would be like an interactive experience videogame that are user driven. The player controls the storyline by choosing choices from numerous decisions provided inside the videogame. When a child is given the ability to choose, automatic trust develops and further these decisions and choices made through the videogame will be used to examine the stress and trauma triggers in the children. The process of playing the game will help them identify feelings of fear and stress. The questions will also help create a glimpse into the personality of the child through avatar creations. The information caught will be kept secure utilizing a unique mark verification gadget associated with the framework. Hence when the youngster returns for another meeting, he/she can start where they halted in the past meeting. Our design is a mode of information collection as well as a way to ease a child into therapy by creating a safe space for the child to share their story. The game can be created utilizing Unity Software and Blender and the interfacing should be possible utilizing python and a unique mark sensor.",
