The designed FLC uses an adaptive fuzzy inference system (AFIS), utilizing selftuning membership functions and rule optimization through metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). A hybrid model-free and model-based framework is used to improve robustness, where reinforcement learning optimizes fuzzy rule sets online to achieve optimal control action.

Usually, conventional DC-DC boost converter shows lower efficiency and extra components for soft-switching. Further, converter power transfer efficiency for PV integration is limited. Hence, to address these challenges this paper investigates an isolated DC-DC resonant converter with proposed control to attain wider voltage regulation with maximized PV power generation. In addition, this converter can achieve zero voltage switching under wider operating loads. The proposed control method improves the efficiency even under light load condition without effecting digital-signal-processor resolution, along with a simple Perturb and Observe maximum power point PI control approach. A 2.2-kW prototype is built and operated to interface PV system and to verify the performance over entire load. The peak efficiency of the converter is found to be 98.7% at (1.1-kW) 50% of the full load. Utilization of solar photovoltaic Cell (SPVC) has significantly increased in residential, commercial, and industrial due to freely available. From the power-voltage (P–V) curve, fluctuation has been revealed over an hour because of varying irradiance, and temperature of sun rays. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) has been essential to track power and maximize the output from SPVC constantly. In this study, a novel Improved Incremental Conductance (IIC) MPPT technique is proposed, and integrated with a boost converter to take out the maximum power from SPVC. The output power has been provided to a brushless DC motor. Pulse Width modulation (PWM) commutation system has been employed to control through the 3-level bridge converter. The complete analysis has been examined at different irradiation conditions. Power consumption, loss, and efficiency have been estimated. Simulation results have been compared with conventional incremental conductance (IC). The proposed IIC MPPT has an improved 5% of tracking efficiency than conventional MPPT techniques. The results show that the effectiveness of the proposed IIC technique has attained a steady state in varying irradiation levels. In spite of the low irradiation level of 250 W/m2, the system remains effective."

The system takes advantage of the ability of GNNs in modeling the relation and trends between the tumor cells and immune cells at the single cell level by presenting the cells as nodes and the interactions between the cells as edges in the structure of a graph. This platform thus allows for the proper dissection of the tumor microenvironment in terms of the specific individual components and how they exist in regard to each other within tissue space and time. The process not only benefits from the application of GNNs, which can describe the interaction of the malignant and immune cells in a heterogeneous manner but also offers a higher resolution of the molecular data associated with cancer progression immunosuppression or response to treatments. The rationality of modelling these interactions with high spatial and temporal resolution is that it presents inherent benefits over other approaches that use bulk RNA-seq or non-dynamic machine learning models accustomed to ignoring heterogeneous and constantly changing tumor-immune behaviors. The graph approach used in the model permits the discovery of the biomarkers, prognosis of cancer progression, and the prescription of individualized treatments for cancer.

Hydrogen (H2), recognized for its cleanliness and renewability, is poised to meet future energy requirements. Consequently, ongoing research is focused on the development of electro-active, durable, and cost-effective catalysts to replace expensive noble metal-based electrocatalysts. At present, hydrogen (H2), a high-energy fuel that is eco-friendly and easy to store, is considered to be the most promising clean energy. One particularly promising means of producing H2 is electrochemical water splitting. The Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), a half-reaction of electrochemical water splitting, is an effective method for harvesting electrical energy from chemical energy. Notably, using hydrogen fuel is assumed to be the most promising alternate to ranch zero carbon by 2050. Presently, the best solid catalyst for electrocatalytic H2 evolution is the noble metal platinum (Pt). However, Pt is relatively rare, rendering it expensive and not suitable for large-scale production. Therefore, the design of less expensive catalysts with higher activity is paramount for large-scale application of the electrochemical HER. It remains a challenge to develop highly active catalysts based on materials that are abundant and at low cost. In this study, microscale. chalcogenides derived from a single crystal is reported as promising electrocatalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) as well as Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) with a remarkably low overpotential"

Current systems using solely infrared sensors struggle to differentiate between animals and vehicles, leading to inaccurate hazard warnings. This proposed system addresses this limitation by incorporating a multi-sensor approach. It utilizes an infrared (IR) sensor to detect obstacle size, a passive infrared (PIR) sensor to detect movement, and a metal sensor to detect the presence of metallic objects, thereby distinguishing between animals/humans and vehicles. The system logic, implemented using an Arduino controller, identifies an animal/human when the PIR sensor detects movement and the metal sensor does not detect metal. Conversely, a vehicle is identified when all three sensors are triggered: the PIR sensor detects movement (potentially from occupants), the IR sensor detects a vehicle-sized object, and the metal sensor detects metal. Distinct warning signals are then transmitted to approaching drivers based on the identified obstacle. This system aims to provide more accurate and context-specific warnings, improving road safety and mitigating the risks associated with navigating hazardous hairpin bends. The multi-sensor fusion approach offers a significant improvement over existing single-sensor systems ."

Due to node and network constraints, the IoT protocol stack differs from the web stack. In networks with intermittent connectivity, and low data rates, classical routing is inefficient for data management. The IETF Routing Over Low-power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) working group developed Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for such networks. RPL has two modes: Storing and Non-Storing. Each node has routing information to communicate during Storing mode. Non-Storing mode stores routing information only in the root node. The attacker can exploit RPL's non-storing feature. When sending UDP or control messages to child nodes, the root node saves routing information in the extended header of IPv6 packets. The attacker can change the source routing header address, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This attack is known as Hatchetman attack. We invented non-cooperative game theoretic approach to identify and mitigate the Hatchetman attack in IoT. This approach is non-cryptographic, lightweight, efficient and distributed in nature."

The whole system is implemented on a single board computer. It is a tri-axial Helmholtz coil-based system which functions in closed loop using two Model Reference Adaptive Controllers (MRAC) so as to minimize the field variations. The intensity of the magnetic field can be varied between ±0.025µT and±200µT within a cubical volume of 15 x 15 x 15 cm3 by varying the coil current. To achieve a stable and uniform magnetic field, geomagnetic field compensation along all three axes was done with the help of two MRA controllers. Through the usage of MRAC, lower settling time, adaptability to external field disturbances and better control stability could be achieved at lower computational complexity. The system achieves field uniformity better than 0.1% and a field setting within 0.25% of the desired magnetic field by fusion of two reference flux-gate sensors working in closed-loop."

        "abstract": "Cache memory controllers function as essential traffic managers within a computer's architecture, optimizing data flow between the central processing unit (CPU) and the cache memory—a high-speed storage layer positioned closer to the CPU than the main memory (RAM). The primary purpose of these controllers is to minimize latency and maximize throughput, thereby enhancing the overall speed and efficiency of the system. If we think of a computer as a busy office, cache memory controllers act as office managers, streamlining processes to ensure quick and efficient data handling. These controllers employ sophisticated algorithms and techniques to expedite data access. One such technique is data prefetching, where the controller anticipates future data requests by the CPU and pre-emptively loads the required data into the cache. This reduces wait times and keeps the CPU from idling. Another critical function is cache replacement policies, which determine which data to evict from the cache when it becomes full. Common policies include Least Recently Used (LRU), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), and Least Frequently Used (LFU). Lastly, cache coherence and synchronization mechanisms ensure that all parts of a multi-core system have a consistent view of memory, crucial for maintaining data integrity across the system. The development process involved designing and simulating various cache memory components, such as data caches (D-cache) and instruction caches (I-cache), using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). These components were integrated into a comprehensive cache controller unit. Verilog simulations enabled us to generate precise timing reports for systems with and without the cache controller. By analysing these reports, we observed a significant reduction in memory access latency and an increase in throughput when a cache controller was implemented, demonstrating its vital role in optimizing data access and overall system performance. Cache memory controllers, akin to unsung heroes in computing, work tirelessly behind the scenes, employing advanced algorithms and intelligent designs to ensure systems remain responsive and efficient. As processing demands continue to escalate with the advancement of technology, these controllers are indispensable in maintaining optimal performance, reducing power consumption, and facilitating complex digital operations. Their ongoing evolution is critical for the future of high-performance computing, enabling rapid data retrieval and seamless user experiences."

The spoons usage is at huge quantities in food service sector and hence the current investigation stressed on the edible spoons making. This study emphasized on the development of edible spoons out of ziziphus which is seasonal and high in nutrients. Standardization of edible spoons, nutrient estimation, microbial analysis and shelf-life study were the major experimentations conducted during the present study. Instead of wheat flour alone, composite flour containing wheat, pearl millet, soybean, chickpea and peanuts was used in the formulation of edible spoons. Three trials were formulated with the incorporation of ziziphus pulp at the levels of 5, 10 and 15 per cent and accordingly, the composite flour proportion was adjusted. The remaining ingredients of skim milk powder and sugar powder were equally maintained in all trials. Furthermore, Ziziphus high nutritional content adds to the spoons' allure while providing users with additional health advantages.Sensory evaluation results received high acceptability with the second trial with the inclusion of ziziphus pulp at 10 per cent proportion. Nutritionally, the developed spoons found to be rich in protein, calcium and iron and low in fat content. Shelf-life study findings well demonstrated consumers’ acceptance on sensory evaluation and ensured safety consumption on testing microbial analysis with the evidence of microbial assays within safe permissible limits. It is advised that more study be done to improve manufacturing procedures and investigate the possibility of commercialising Ziziphus edible spoons on a large scale at industrial level.Biodegradability nature of ingredients used, associated nutritional, therapeutic and medicinal benefits and health conscious consumer behaviour may provide the insights of edible spoons to emerge as the successful alternative technology to single-use plastic cutlery.

Traditional wheelchair controls, such as joysticks or buttons, often pose challenges for users with physical impairments, restricting their ability to operate the wheelchair independently. This invention addresses these challenges by integrating gesture recognition technology into wheelchair control systems, allowing users to control the movement of their wheelchair through simple hand gestures. The system utilizes motion sensors or cameras to detect hand movements, which are then translated into control signals for the wheelchair. These gestures can include actions such as swiping, pointing, or waving, with each gesture corresponding to specific commands, such as moving forward, backward, turning, or stopping. The gesture signals are transmitted wirelessly to the wheelchair’s control unit, which processes the data and adjusts the wheelchair's movement accordingly. In addition to gesture control, the system is designed to ensure safety and usability. It includes features such as real-time feedback, using visual or haptic signals to confirm that the system has recognized the user's gestures and the wheelchair is responding appropriately. Furthermore, the system is customizable to meet the unique needs of individual users, allowing for personalized gesture settings based on the user’s abilities. By eliminating the need for physical input devices, the Hand Gesture Controller for Wheelchair empowers users with limited mobility to operate their wheelchair freely and intuitively, improving their overall quality of life.

Based on the height information at workplace, we developed mathematical algorithms to limit the extension of excavator components. The operator does not need to worry and control the operation. Our algorithms will limit the movement of excavator components automatically.

In modern power systems, the control of frequency in multiple regions is a complex task, largely due to the interdependence of power flows and frequency deviations between interconnected regions. Traditional AGC systems face challenges in maintaining independent control over each region's frequency while ensuring the stability of the overall system. This is further complicated by the interactions between regions, where a change in one region's frequency can affect the other. The proposed invention introduces a simplified decoupler that acts as an interface between the two-region power system and the IMC-based fractional AGC controllers. The IMC-based controllers independently manage the frequency deviations in each region, providing corrective signals to mitigate these deviations. The role of the decoupler is to ensure that the control actions for one region dq not interfere with or destabilize the other region, effectively decoupling the control dynamics of the two regions. This novel decoupler reduces the complexity of traditional decoupling ·me,chanisms while maintaining high performance in terms of frequency stabilization and power sharing. By simplifying the control architecture, the invention enhances tlie overall robustness and stability of the AGC system, minimizing the computational burden typically associated with fractional-order control strategies. Additionally, the invention provides · an efficient solution for maintaining coordinated control in interconnected power systems, improving ·both dynamic response and operational reliability."

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to develop a model of addiction to social networking games that is tardy and has a contagion rate that is classified into several categories. An optimal control method is developed on the basis of tlie Pontryagin maximum principle in order to successfully regulate the extent to which game addiction is propagated. Taking into consideration the education of families, a new dynamic model of the addiction that teens have to playing online games is built in order to investigate the most effective method for preventing the development of game addiction. To begin, we do a qualitative version of the dynamic analysis of the model. Among the topics that we investigate are the nonnegativity and boundedness of solutions, the fundamental reproduction number Ro, the presence of equilibria, and their stability. Then, we take into consideration a model that includes control measures of family education, isolation, and treatment, and we acquire the expression of optimal control. It is possible to explore the influence of tine delays and the conditions that are suitable for the actuality of Hopf bifurcation by employing the viable combinations of the delays as a bifurcation constraint throughout the investigation. The exhaustion of center manifold theory also leads to the acquisition of specific formulas for determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the permanence of the bifurcating periodic choices. With the help of the MATLAB software program, a few numerical replications are carried out in order to provide a directive to interpretation for the approval of theoretical findings. In conclusion, this is done in order to provide a directive to interpretation."

The polymer resist layer is patterned using photolithography, while the metal layer is patterned using corresponding wet or dry etch recipes. The patterning of stacked polymer-metal resist increases the carbon footprint of the mask fabrication process. Scanning probe lithography techniques are a set of patterning techniques using which metal thin films can be etched without the use of any polymer resists. Since dry etch recipes are often highly selective to metals, thin layers of patterned metal can help to achieve high etch depths. Thus, direct-write SPL methods can be employed in the fabrication of hard masks for dry etching of substrates in a single, cost-effective step with a lower carbon footprint. The present invention proposes a resistless single-step hard-masking technique using electrolithography."

This innovation provides a balance between performance, power efficiency, and radiation resilience, making it suitable for aerospace, military, and other mission-critical applications. This innovation investigates how ionized radiation particles altered the data stored in the 8T SRAM cell by offering an analysis of suitable radiation hardening. Because of its lower critical charge value, this 8T SRAM cell is prone to soft errors. For 8T SRAM cells spanning 45nm technology nodes at 1V supply voltage, the mitigation of flipping data induced by radiation hardening is being investigated using the Cadence Virtuoso tool."

This type of controller is suitable for real time operation and aims to improve the dynamic characteristics of the generating unit by acting properly on its original excitation system. The modeling of the power system under study consists of a synchronous generator connected via a transformer and a transmission line to an infinite bus. Next, digital simulations of the above system are performed using fuzzy control techniques that are based on previous work. The dynamic performances of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers (IT2FLC) along with Interval type-1 Fuzzy logic controller in short FLC is presented by comparison using the integral square error criterion (ISE). Typical transient responses of the system are shown for comparison in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The computer simulation results obtained demonstrate clearly that the performance of the developed controller offers competitive damping effects on the generator oscillations, with respect to the associated ones of the FLC, over a wider range of operating conditions, while their hardware implementation is easier and the computational time needed for real-time applications is drastically reduced. In MATLAB/SIMULINK is simulated model of the synchronous generator connected to an AC system. A simple fuzzy logic control scheme is simulated for voltage control and generator stabilization."

This invention addresses Single-Input Dual-Output (SIDO) DC–DC converters, specifically Magnetically Coupled Inductor SIDO (CI-SIDO) converters. Minimizing inductor current ripples is vital in the design of DC–DC converters. Among the various pre-existing techniques of ripple minimization, the shifting of one gate pulse in relation to the other stands out as a simple and highly effective method for SIDO converters. However, the actual required relative shift is definite for every operating condition of the converter and dependent on different circuit parameters. Achieving the precise shifts at high frequencies in CI-SIDO converters often requires complex programmable digital controllers like FPGA or DSP. Also, with changing operating conditions of the converters, complex calculations are required to find out the relative shift for each case. This invention introduces a simplified expression for a relative shift, significantly reducing inductor current ripples of the CI-SIDO converters irrespective of switching frequencies and operating conditions. Additionally, the invention proposes a simple analog circuitry capable of generating the necessary time-shifted gate pulses, offering a simpler and more practical solution for enhancing the performance of CI-SIDO converters."

Particularly for the individuals with paralysis, like quadriplegics, who endure immense suffering as a result of their physical restrictions. The development of a tool to help those with paralysis, likequadriplegics, is now imperative. In addition, individuals are keen to digitise their daily lives in an effort to engage in less physical activity. Our notion is to create an assist device that would enable someone to operate any item they use in their everyday life with less physical effort and would allow us to automate our home's electrical appliances simply by blinking our eyelids. Although there have been anumber of prototypes created in the past, most of them lack originality or are not user-friendly. The project's objective is to develop a tiny, user-friendly ocular controlling webcam-based home automation system that can power electrical equipment in the house. This will also save energy usage and enable a patient who is disabled to operate the fans and lights without assistance. The setup uses a webcam which is programmed using AI technology to-trace the blink count. The_blink_count is transferre_d_ to both the appliances through Wi-fi connection in which it checks for its compatible programmed values and the respective appliance is controlled by the relay module accordingly. It is to be discerned thatour innovation provides a greater enhancement in the life of paralytic and also ensures a higher accuracy rate when compared with the existing devices."

The distal perilaryngeal cuff prevents the leak of the gases into the esophagus avoiding gastric insufflation and also prevents aspiration of gastric contents. The pharyngeal cuff prevents the escape of the gases through mouth and nose, so that the gases go through the laryngeal inlet.

While CNN-based approaches have significantly improved image quality in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM), they often demand substantial computing power, hindering their practical use. Additionally, many existing CNN models fail to fully utilize intermediate features crucial for precise image reconstruction. To tackle these challenges, the article introduces MADNet, a novel lightweight network design.MADNet focuses on enhancing multiscale feature expression and learning feature correlations efficiently. It introduces a Residual Multiscale Module with Attention Mechanism (RMAM) to bolster the representation of informative multicale features. This module helps in capturing diverse features across different scales, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the input image. Moreover, MADNet incorporates a Dual Residual-Path Block (DRPB) to leverage hierarchical features extracted from the original low-resolution images. By integrating these features at multiple levels, MADNet ensures a richer understanding of the image content, which aids in more accurate super resolution. MADNet utilizes dense connections between blocks to enhance information flow and facilitate feature reuse effectively.These connections enable seamless communication between different layers, promoting feature propagation and enhancing the overall performance of the network.Importantly, comparative evaluations show that MADNet outperforms existing models while utilizing significantly fewer computational resources, as measured by multiadds and parameters. This efficiency makes MADNet a promising solution for real-world applications where computational resources are limited."

The h-FL-PO-FPID controller is a hybrid controller made up of the fractional PID (FO-PID) controller, the fuzzy logic controller, and the Poisson distribution (PO) controller. There are numerous difficulties associated with integrating PMSG with the grid via rectifier and inverter, including excessive peak overshoot, lengthy settling times, increased harmonic content at the output, and inappropriate voltage profiles. Total harmonic distortion (THD), a measure of harmonics, is used. The PMSG is powered by a windmill. Fuzzy logic, and PID controllers have all been used to evaluate the control of rectifiers and inverters. Three different ways have been devised for a closed loop current control system to control rectifiers and inverters. h-FL-PO-FPID is reported to have the lowest peak overshoot (%) and settling time (sec) of the DC link voltage and rotor speed when compared to FLC and existing approaches. Additionally, improved voltage profiles are gained with h-FL-PO-FPID in contrast to other approaches, resulting in h-FL-PO-FPID achieving the three-phase voltage with the least amount of THD (%)."

The invention focuses on biodiesel production from the high viscosity and FFA of oil in less reaction time, energy, and consuming chemicals. In the Shockwave Power Reactor, the rotating part of the high-speed rotor installed in the fixed part of the stator, and the main features of these rotor-stator devices are their high speed and shear.

This uses a combination of advanced strategies to enhance cybersecurity resilience and effectively prevent potential breaches. Technical implementation: Technical implementation of The Hacker's Maze begins with the deployment of a complex and attractive \"honeypot\" environment. This decoy environment closely mirrors the appearance and behaviour of the actual target system, making it irresistible to potential hackers. Intrusion detection mechanisms are strategically placed throughout the network to continuously monitor incoming trafFic. When an intrusion attempt is detected, the system transparently redirects the attacker to an isolated virtual environment. This isolated environment is carefully designed to reproduce critical elements of the main system while keeping it separate from truly sensitive data and content. The Hacker's Maze's main strength is its use'of strong security keys. These cryptographic keys act as formidable barriers to attackers' advancement in isolated environments. Each key is unique, constantly changing, and highly resistant to unauthorized use, making it very difficult for hackers to crack or bypass them. When faced with strong security keys, attackers attempting to breach or compromise them are met with swift action. The system activates the lock automatically to deal with any key breach, effectively stopping the hacker's progress and limiting his actions only to an isolated environment."

Batteries for electric vehicles are typically too costly and out of reach for most consumers. The procedure starts with the battery part of an electric vehicle being mathematically modeled. There are several elements to the cost of an electric car battery, including wear, revenue, and degradation costs. Concerns include not only this but also appropriately managing the battery's state of charge (SOC). A multi-objective functional has been formulated in terms of wear cost, revenue cost, degradation cost, power flow, SOC, and other unidentified factors in order to address such problems. The heuristic Taylor ANN controller, or h-Taylor-ANN controller, is used to train the multi-objective function. The evaluation of multiple performance indicators, such as wear, revenue, and degradation costs, as well as the overall battery cost, has been conducted using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) for varying SOC (%) values. Furthermore, as opposed to PSO and IWO, the h-Taylor-ANN controller provides smooth control over the power flow for charging electric vehicles. Comparing the h-Taylor-ANN controller to PSO and IWO, it is seen that efficiency measures such as degradation cost, revenue cost, wear cost, and overall battery cost are lower. The h-Taylor-ANN controller's supremacy is also seen in the battery's decreased total cost."

Wind and solar are chosen as the two most popular renewable energy sources, which are suitably applied in micro-grid systems. A novel approach to maximize the power delivery from solar and wind is developed in this work, with a single DC-DC converter, namely double input buck buck-boost converter (DIBBFC), which is operated with two switches only. One of the two switches controls the output voltage of the PV panel, achieving maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of PV through it. The other switch is deployed to maintain the output DC voltage across load, by drawing the required power from the wind energy conversion system. The associated permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is controlled through a machine side voltage source converter (MVSC), to produce fixed DC voltage at the higher voltage side of the double input buck buck-boost converter. The DC output of the double input buck buck-boost converter is converted to AC by one load-side voltage source converter (LVSC). The LVSC synchronizes the output AC with the grid and also controls the power flow to the grid. The control of the grid-connected LVSC is found successful in both simulation and real-time environments. The power reference varied with variation in wind velocity and the required power flow from the PMSG is presented in simulation and real-time successfully. Two different sources, with two different levels of output voltages, with two different dynamics, are integrated to achieve the MPPT of both, which have been achieved for the first time. Figure 1"

By interleaving multiple converters, this technique distributes the workload among individual converters, reducing switching losses and improving overall system efficiency. The developed prototype has been used in single-input multiple-output (SIMO) applications. This combined converter allows obtaining dual output voltages of the same value, from a single input DC voltage and with only a power switch. Multiphase interleaved DC-DC converters achieve a better dynamic response and low ripple, maintaining their efficiency. Each converter is connected in parallel, thereby managing their losses by distributing them between more components, which facilitates the thermal management of the multiphase converter and allows handling high power values in small sizes with respect to solutions for a single phase. Two control strategies were applied: synchronous operation mode (SOM) and interleaved operation mode (IOM). The simulation results allow the comparison of both operational modes, verifying that the IOM presents advantages with respect to the ripple at the input and output currents. Figure 1."

The AC output current is controlled by a direct hysteresis current regulation method, in which actual values of the AC output current are compared with their boundary values that are found online using a digital microcontroller. The boundary values of the phase currents are calculated such that the inverter switching frequency remains constant under all possible operating modes. The control method also takes care of certain unavoidable effects on current controller’s performance due to sampling delay of digital controller, winding resistance of filter reactors, mismatch of filter inductances, dead time of switching devices and propagation time in gate driver circuits.

These devices accurately regulate how much energy is used to protect against any unnecessary water/electricity usage. Over time, the money saved is quite substantial. The wires from the circuit are put into the tank at different levels and when water level is below green wire level the pump is turned on and starts filling the tank. When the water level in the tank reaches above the green wire level the transistor will start to conduct as the base gets current flown through the red wire but the SCR will still not conduct as the gate connected to yellow wire is not charged.Which results in the relay still not turned on and outputing 12 V keeping the pump turned on. When the water level in the tank reaches the yellow wire level the transistor and the SCR will start to conduct which turns the relay on and makes it output 0V which results in the turning off of the pump. Even when the water level reaches below the yellow wire level the SCR will still conduct as it will have a holding current flowing through it since the transistor is conducting and will continue to keep the relay turned on and output 0V keeping the pump off. Now when the water level reaches below the green wire level the transistor will stop conducting and the SCR will also stop conducting as well (since the holding current drops to 0) therefore the relay gets turned off and will output 12 V turning on the pump and the cycle repeats."

In this regard, the inverter circuit plays an important role in the applications of industrial drives. The industrial drives are operated at high rated power and the conventional inverters cannot be applicable for high power demands because of the large dV/dt (rate of change of voltage) and more switching losses. Therefore, multilevel inverters are introduced for high power-medium voltage applications. For all AC drives the MLIs are reliable in operation. This MLI topology also reduces the harmonics and bearings stress of a motor with low dV/dt. In most applications multilevel inverters are used because we can get a greater number of voltage levels. To increase the number of voltage levels, circuit needs to have more switches. But we have to optimize the switch count and switching operations. The power level of the inverter is limited due to high currents and stress. In this paper, we proposed a new circuit topology which enables the switches to be active at different voltage levels, causes reduction of the switching losses and also increases the efficiency of the inverter. In this we have presented two configurations for an eleven level MLI for three phase induction motor drive application. In this an individual DC source is connected for each bridge circuit of each phase in one configuration and only one common DC link is used for three phases in another configuration. With this the size, cost and complexity could be decreased. In both the configurations the controlled output of the inverter is connected to the induction motor drive. The circuits are modelled using MATLAB/Simulink software and corresponding output waveforms are analysed for both configurations FIG.1"

In order to satisfy the H∞ norm bound restriction on disturbance attenuation, the control strategy focuses on creating a control law that can stabilize the closed-loop system in the presence of uncertainty in the controller parameters. The suggested control method aids in managing the unavoidable uncertainties that arise when implementing any control scheme. The suggested control method is contrasted with the traditional strategy, and the outcomes of experiments verify its validity. The experimental findings are derived from a 1-kW TSBB converter prototype with an output voltage range of 150–400 V in the lab.

The design of Traditional Surgical Gowns is flawed which is associated with a waste of textiles, resources, and more waste generation. I designed a gown that not only requires a lesser amount of raw products but is also friendly to the environment. There are two types of gowns: disposable and reusable. Disposable gowns are generally disposed of by landfilling. We all know, it has detrimental effects on the environment. Therefore, I have designed a gown, called the Aarush Mini Surgical Gown, which will save approximately 40-50% of the plastic waste without compromising the sterility of the operative field. In the case of the re-usable gown, it will save about a similar amount of cloth. It will not only be cost-effective but most importantly save our environment. Material and Methods: the forearms and front of the gowns are the critical areas of the gown whereas back of the gown is non-critical So based on the above the following design is suggested. Design: 1. Back of the gown: Being a non-critical area, it doesn’t offer any benefit for the overall sterility of the selected cases. Hence, the back of the gown is not required. 2. Length of the gown: Traditional gowns are ankle-lengths which is unnecessary in most situations. In many operations, anything below the waist length won’t offer any protection. Results: Traditional gown requires 350 cm X 90 cm of textile for a single gown whereas my proposed design requires 180 cm X 90 cm of textile. It saved about 45-50% of textiles (disposable or reusable). This gown was used by the surgical team of the Department of Plastic Surgery and found to be equally efficacious and more comfortable. It is cost-effective, requires a lesser amount of plastics, generates less waste, and hence is more environmentally friendly. Conclusion: The Aarush Mini Surgical Gown is a Unique design that can have wider applications. This design will not only save resources but most importantly the environment."

The methodology involves the implementation of metallic elliptical rings (102) & (103) that are inclined and positioned on the upper layer of the FR4 substrate (101) to manifest a band-stop characteristic spanning from 6.7 to 12.1 GHz, exhibiting attenuation levels above -10 dB at 0? incidence of electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, the elliptical rings FSS unit cell size measures 0.14?? x 0.14??, demonstrating exceptional polarization insensitivity up to 90? owing to its diagonally symmetrical geometry. Maintaining an angular stability bandwidth of 2 GHz from 9.2 to 11.2 GHz at 80? oblique incidence of electromagnetic waves. The interelement spacing within the elliptical rings FSS structure plays a pivotal role in reducing the size and grating lobes. Consequently, the elliptical rings FSS (100) emerges as a highly promising solution for effectively shielding X-Band frequencies."

In these situations, this project provides a solution by using GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) to determine the overall maximum load that it is intended to bear. A gadget is fabricated that measures the combined weight of the driver and passengers and turns off the ignition of the vehicle when the maximum load is reached. The apparatus consists of an Arduino board, load cells, relay, bulb and buzzer that are connected. The load cell gives the value of the load that is carried and transmits the information to the Arduino board, which processes the data, displayed through an LED display to the driver and turns off the ignition of the engine by leaving the relay circuit open if the weight value exceeds the maximum load capacity of the vehicle. There are different load cells available for weighing different weights. So based on how much weight is to be measured the load cells are selected to use. The part of start /stop of the engine is taken care by the relay. Relay receives an input from arduino on whether to open the circuit or to close. When the threshold is crossed arduino sends a signal to open the circuit such that engine is shut off. If the load is within the threshold arduino does not change the default value of relay set as closed-circuit allowing engine to turn on. If not, it closes the relay circuit to allow the ignition to start.

The results show that the population growth prediction using REGT captures the presence of non-linearity in the actual data and this improves the accuracy of prediction. The REGT model captures the effects of seasonality, demographics and other factors and that largely affects the prediction rate.

Various characterization techniques and I–V measurements were used to analyze their optical, microstructural, chemical, morphological, and electrical properties at room temperature. The direct optical bandgaps of double interlayer films are higher than the single-layer films. XRD, FESEM, EDX, XPS, and AFM analysis revealed the Si3N4 and ZrO2 films formation at the interface.

The moving object may be subjected to jerk or vibration if the time vs speed curve is not properly designed. Higher rate of change of speed leads to the jerk in the object and higher deceleration also causes the vibration in the object. Therefore it is recommended to design the suitable closed loop position control system with smooth acceleration and deceleration characteristics. Torque and speed control loops are deciding the performance of the drive system and its loading capacity.

        "abstract": "Researchers are enthusiastically interested in thermal energy storage (TES) systems for harnessing solar energy through the use of phase change materials (PCMs) for absorption, employing organic and inorganic materials that are prominent due to their potential in harnessing solar energy. However, solar stills can produce potable water, but it has been limited. The primary objective of this is to study distillate production, enhance thermal efficiency, and reduce overall cost of distillate generated through a steeped M-shape basin single slope solar still (SMBSSS). The study assesses the impact of three modifications on the thermo-economic performance of SMBSSS systems, incorporating them as TES materials and thermal property enhancers. The composite PCM, comprising organic paraffin RT50 (PR) and Silver nanoparticles (SN) from Manihot esculenta extracting solutions (ME), has been examined (PRSNME) using various analytical techniques to investigate its physical and chemical. Furthermore, this nano-composites have been rigorously evaluated over 500 thermal cycles to validate their exceptional performance. Results indicate that the thermal conductivity of PR increased by 53.85% when SNME nanoparticles were added at a weight ratio of 0.8%, with negligible changes in latent heat values. Notably, the thermal stability of PRSNME improved slightly, with a shift from 300°C to 330°C. Passive solar desalination, employing PRSNME to support PCMs with a melting point around 50°C, has recently gained attention, enabling the secure storage of thermal energy. Design testing revealed that SMBSSS with PRSNME was 209% more efficient than conventional CSS, with a 26% increase in Manihot esculenta extraction production. Basin absorber testing underscores the superior performance of SMBSSS, exhibiting an 85% boost in productivity and a 47% improvement in thermal efficiency compared to conventional solar stills (CSS)."

Maintaining a certain power quality standard is essential for various applications to ensure smooth operation and minimize technical issues, which in turn reduces energy costs. One important parameter that determines power quality is the mains power factor, which indicates the efficiency of the power system. Reduced efficiency results when the power factor drops due to an increase in the demand for reactive power. To address this, capacitance of the required value needs to be added to the system when the power factor falls below the specified value, preferably 0.92. The addition of capacitors helps to reduce losses and improve the power factor. This project proposes a digitally controlled topology for Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) to improve power quality. The design and simulation of an APFC system using Arduino UNO microcontroller is presented in the paper. The system monitors the power factor using a power factor transducer, followed by the Arduino microcontroller which controls the switching of capacitor banks to compensate for reactive power and bring the power factor close to unity, thereby enhancing power quality. The simulation results are also presented in the paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system in improving power quality by maintaining a high power factor."

The ACHMI system is composed of power stage circuit and control system, where the control system contains the dual-loop current control strategy established in the hybrid reference frame (HRF), the synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL) and the hybrid modulation method - employed to synthesize the multilevel output voltage. The small-signal model of the whole ACHMI system is first established by using a simple step-by-step derivation method, and then, the small-signal analysis method is adopted to linearize the ACHMI, which is then utilized to derive the impedance model of the ACHMI system. Furthermore, an improved impedance stability criterion is derived, which is then employed to analyse the system stability. By using this criterion, the stability of the ACHMI can be evaluated with the variation-of the bandwidth of PLL, the output power factor angle of the ACHMI and the amplitude of the grid current reference signal under weak gridponditions. In this invention, a systematic design procedure for the optimal selection of the proportional-integral (PI) controller of the PLL is presented, which guarantees the steady-state performance and dynamic response of the ACHMI system.

The groups of series-connected battery cells are themselves in turn connected in series. The DC/DC converters are connected on the input side to a first pole and to a second pole of a group of battery cells associated with the respective DC/DC converter, and are connected in series 'on the output side between a first output of the battery system and a second output of the battery system. The first switch is connected in a first current path between the first.

When a DC/DC converter switches between a primary voltage control mode, a secondary voltage control mode, and a current limiting mode as operation modes, an I-term resetting processor . outputs an I term depending on the duty ratio in the operation mode before being switched to a PID processor. The PID processor performs a PID control process based on the input 1 term. A drive duty ratio setter outputs a drive duty ratio immediately after the control mode switching, which is substantially equal to the duty ratio in the operation mode before being switched. As a result, the duty ratios in the operation mode before being switched and the operation mode after being switched are made continuous with respect to each other"

        "abstract": "[013]During rescue missions, transferring injured people from accident scenes to rescue sites is considered crucial and time-sensitive. In particular, a one-second delay could put more lives in danger. Though ambulances are commonly equipped with standard siren devices, such siren signals are not recognized by traffic light controllers. Therefore, rescue missions could be delayed at intersections due to an urgency-unaware traffic light‘ control system. In the worst case, ‘ pile-up accidents could also happen when the ambulances lawfully ignores the traffic lights. This invention proposes A2T to enhance the efficiency of rescue missions by establishing a communication mechanism among ambulances and infrastructures (e.g., traffic light controllers). Thailand, which had the highest road traffic death rate in the world in 2015, is selected as a use case in‘this invention. AZT promotes information sharing between ambulances and traffic light controllers along the rescue path in advance. Such information, including speeds, locations, and emergency routes, allows the traffic light controllers to launch a prioritized green traffic light accordingly. This allows the ambulances to go through any road intersection efficiently and safely. Our comprehensive performance evaluation shows that AZT achieves 100 percent waiting time reduction for the ambulances, with only 2.48 percent increase in delay of other vehicles at the intersections. An ambulance comprises a user interface capable of displaying input and output (“I/O”) status information and a control system coupled to the user interface. The user interface is capable of displaying video images from a video camera, map information generated based on a dispatch system, and/or other information."

For the quick and effective functioning of protection schemes, our invention proposes a method to identify and categorize various short circuit defects on transmission lines. Application of evolutionary programming methods allows for differentiation between various failures kinds on transmission lines. The various operational and fault circumstances on the transmission of high voltage lines, including L-L fault, single phase to earth fault, and double line fault, double line three fault scenarios triple line fault, triple line to ground fault, and triple line are simulated using MATLAB software. These flaws damage the linked devices to the power grid. The main motto of this invention is to analyze various kind of faults and also to detect the type of the fault in transmission line. In order to simulate and evaluate the various faults, a 100 km transmission line model was created. The sim power system block library had a fault block, and the harmonic content of the various faults was studied using the FFT tool, the effect of faults was observed. Under various fault situations, a discrete power gui with sampling time Ts=3e-05s was utilized for the simulation investigation. Based on the analysis, a hardware model is designed to identify the faults in transmission line using actuating relays and Atmega328P microcontroller and displays the fault type and parameters like fault impedance, and the distance at which fault occurred. 3 Claims and 3 Figures"

Although desalination presents a feasible alternative, it is energy-intensive and frequently necessitates large-scale units that employ traditional fossil fuels that are both costly and polluting. Therefore, the desalination of seawater requires the usage of renewable energy. Employing geothermal energy for power generation, heating and cooling facilities, and other industrial purposes is possible. Among its many advantages are its extensive beneficial environmental impact, consistent power supply, relatively low levels of greenhouse emissions, and accessibility. The recent invention relates to producing fresh water from seawater using thermal-based desalination technology integrated with geothermal energy. Geothermal energy used as a heating source to power a single-effect evaporator (SEE) desalination system."

In this work, we focus on hybrid systems powered by solar and wind energy. In order to get the most out of the PV and wind energy systems, an MPPT based DC-DC converter is used. The efficiency of several MPPT methods, such as the P&O method, applied for hybrid systems was compared. To boost power reliability, an ANFIS approach is used to the inverter controller's dc link voltage. Several MPPT techniques are tried out on this hybrid system in Matlab/Simulink, and the results are compared across a wide range of load circumstances and fault analyses."

Most digital systems utilized a two-state set and are referred to as binary. Digital modulation impresses a digital data set; known as a pulse train, onto a signal suitable for transmission. For long distance and wireless transmission, bandpass modulation (or carrier modulation) is usually used. The three carrier modulation techniques examined by this invention named as BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift Keying) and 16-QAM along with their associated demodulation techniques. In the field of a data and digital communication course the modulation techniques play a significant role to design the performance efficient system.

There have been several advancements in technology and a lot of research has been done to help the people who are deaf and dumb. Aiding the cause, Deep learning, and computer vision can be used too to make an impact on this cause. This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all, moreover, this can be extended to creating automatic editors, where the person can easily write by just their hand gestures. This system wills assistance those folks by providing an intermediate to communicate. It is implemented using Open cv python concept based gesture recognition. When the dumb people will use gesture through fingers this system will convert into voice to communicate with other people. The raspberry pi 3B model is used and to play the audio file using python."

A smart dustbin connected with a server, which is a sustainable and efficient solution for waste management. The smart dustbin is equipped with sensors and a Wi-Fi module, which enables it to transmit real-time data to a server. The server can use this data to optimize waste collection and management, reduce costs, and promote sustainability. The smart dustbin is powered by a solar panel, making it environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The sensors in the dustbin can detect the fill level and type of waste, which is transmitted to the server. The server can then analyze this data to determine the optimal collection route and schedule. And also inform the users about the data of the dustbin via an application through the server. By categorizing waste as dry or wet, the camera sensor can enable more efficient waste disposal. Dry waste can be directed to recycling centers, while wet waste can be processed and disposed of in a more appropriate manner, such as composting or landfill. By using solar power, the smart dustbin can reduce its carbon footprint and help to minimize the use of non-renewable energy sources. The locking of the lid after the 90% filled space is helpful in preventing overfilling, reducing odor’s and keeping the space clean. By tracking the fill level of each dustbin and identifying areas where bins tend to fill up quickly, the system could help waste management companies plan more efficient collection routes, reducing the amount of time and resources needed to collect garbage. The notification and mapping system on the user’s mobile application makes it more convenient for users to find empty dustbins nearby, reducing the time and unnecessary effort required to dispose of waste. The data received from the smart dustbin can be analyzed to identify patterns and trends in waste management. This can help to inform future waste management strategies and promote sustainability."

There are only four ultrasonic sensors in the train detection module and one ultrasonic sensor in the stuck detection module. Both the train detection and stuck detection module generate high frequency signals through the ultrasonic sensors and detect the presence of an object if the echo is received back by the sensors. Then the controller unit determines whether the obstacle is train or stuck and takes necessary steps by controlling the gate, alarm generator and signal lights. Experimental studies show that the proposed methodology provides a more cost effective, reliable and simpler railway gate controller than existing dominant work. Human safety is a major goal for Railways. The intention of this paper is to achieve automatic control at the level crossings when the arrival/departure of the train takes place replacing the manual gate control. The railway gate automatically is closed when a train passes through the railway crossing. The detection of arrival and departure of trains is done by using two IR sensors. The gate opening and closing is to be done using servo motors which are controlled by Arduino Uno. In addition, with this the status of the gate will be given to the motorman well in advance which insures more safety from the accident.

We have created a modern filtration system that can be controlled only by voice commands and that also promotes restful sleep by playing calming music at the user's request. The filtration system is a superb example of a contemporary air filtration system that employs HEPA filtration together with additional Ultra violet to filter and, in the process, eliminate any viruses or microorganisms. The user has the option of asking the purifier to announce the degree of pollution in the space right now. Upon receiving this instruction, the system uses the speaker to inform the user of the prevailing PM2.5 and pollution levels values. In order to aid in falling asleep, the user can also instruct the raspberry controller to play relaxation tunes. The system uses a speaker to talk or play music for the user and a microphone to pick up voice from the user's commands."

The respective sensors are implemented into the mushroom cultivation process and connected to the Node MCU microcontroller, which collects and transfers the data to the cloud server, enabling remote access at any time through the end device with-internet connection. The control algorithm regulates the equipment within the cultivational chamber autonomously, based on feedback from the sensors. in order to retain the optimum environment for the cultivation of mushrooms. The sensors were tested and compared with manual readings to ensure their accuracy.

Children in school are being taught about environment and the importance of conserving it. The knowledge about the various environmental aspects like forests, flora, fauna, waterbodies, pollution, etc. is usually imparted via curriculum lectures, annual science fairs, poster making, drawing competitions, etc. While all these medium of imparting knowledge are effective in their own way but they also have some limitations. Lectures or seminars are a more top down approach of imparting knowledge, they can be too overwhelming for small children. A participatory approach towards learning and understanding about the environment can provide an immersive experience for children. A board game is a good old way to bring children together and give an opportunity to participate and engage in a fun activity while learning at the same time. Our country is endowed with a variety of ecosystems like forests, deserts, mountains, rivers, sea, etc. each having a rich biodiversity. These ecosystems not only provide ecological services but also play an important role in sustenance of local communities. The value of these natural ecosystems and their resources is invaluable and awareness about them is important. In recent times, rapid urbanization has started encroaching upon these ecologically sensitive landscapes and many such cases have led to natural disasters. Hence, it is crucial that children learn about these natural ecosystems and their important role in maintaining balance in environment so that they grow up as aware and responsible citizens of tomorrow."

At the current rate of usage, fossil fuels will only last for the next five decades. Climate change is a red flag to not use more fossil fuels. A sustainable alternative for automobile fuels is the electrical cycle, also known as the e-cycle, which is efficient, compact, and comfortable to ride. The e-cycle is the most versatile future vehicle due to its advantages. The project includes a foot-controlled steering system and is designed to be suitable for any road conditions. The current choice of automobile industries and researchers is the permanent magnet brushless direct current motor, which is known for its high power density, compact size, reliability, and low noise and maintenance requirements. The vehicle's design is done using CAD and CRE-O, and simulations models are created. Equipment and cost analysis are also performed, as well as fabrication of the vehicle, including assembly of the skateboard and electric hub motor drive, and designing the controllers. An e-bike motor works by automatically switching on the (quiet) motor when you pedal or use the throttle. A pedal-operated e-bike is the most popular option. As you pedal the bike, the motor is powered, and it works. In contrast, a throttle-assist e-bike is similar to a traditional motorbike, as it operates when you accelerate the throttle. Electric bicycles are available in various styles, from commuter bikes to full-suspension mountain bikes. The power output of these pedal-operated motors is usually regulated and typically available with an output power of around 250 watts. Bikes fitted with a throttle-based motor system have slightly different output regulations, with a maximum power of around 200 watts and a speed limit of 25 kmph. The main reason for identifying and modifying e-bikes is to address the problem of pollution caused by vehicles in urban areas, which is increasing."

The method involves producing a set of 2K outputs that include K real components and K imaginary components from K complex symbols, performing a Fourier transform operation on the 2K outputs to produce 2K Fourier transform outputs, pulse shaping the 2K Fourier transform outputs by multiplying each of J of the 2K Fourier transform outputs with a respective one of J non-zero coefficients, where J is odd, and K=J=2K-1, performing an inverse Fourier transform operation on the J pulse shaped outputs to produce an inverse Fourier transform output; and outputting the inverse Fourier transform output. The approach has the advantage of avoiding self-interference, with the result that better BLER performance may be possible. The approach is applicable to any modulation order without bandwidth expansion. Flexibility is provided through a trade-off between PAPR vs. spectrum efficiency."

There was a moderate impact value (Cohen's d = 0.2) and a statistically significant shift in how students viewed the use of gamification to enhance the learning process (t (1, 49) = 2.369, p = 0.05). The outcomes of this research have imperative implications for both teaching methods and research, as they show that gamification applications could be assimilated entirely into vocabulary instruction to enhance vocabulary surveys and encourage the development of beginner self-rule. However, using an app that was not created, especially for vocabulary acquisition, may not improve performance compared to those who do not obtain gamification assistance, even if student achievement remains good."

The present invention discloses a chemically activated ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) based geopolymeric cement or binder (GPC) and a process to produce the same. Herein geopolymer has been developed in a single component solid powder form, just like conventional cements. The developed GPC is ready to mix with water and aggregates to make mortar and concrete. This cement/binder is completely free from clinker usage favouring minor amount of carbon footprint. This cement has been prepared by blending two solid powder components like alkali activator and precursor. The alkali activator is composed of sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate, sodium sulphate and GGBS. Whereas the precursor is composed of GGBS, fly ash and kaolin. This GPC offers water curing at ambient temperature like other conventional Portland cements. Compressive strength of developed GPC was found 7.79-16.45 after 1 day ambient temperature curing and 29.00-48.20 MPa after 28 days water curing. Applicability of GPC has been further tested by M30 grade concrete trial. The compressive strength of the concrete cube has been appeared 36.50 MPa after 28 days water curing at ambient temperature. Hence the developed GPC has a huge potential to be used as an eco-friendly binding material for construction world like conventional clinker based cement. (Figure 1)"

Humans have been creating compounds for thousands of years to create everything from simple compounds to elaborate electronic devices. Although the first compositions were made from natural materials such as soil and straw, today's compositions are created in a laboratory from synthetic materials. Regardless of their origin, compounds have given rise to life as we know it. Today, the use of composites has grown, usually combining a structural fiber and a plastic, known as fiber reinforced plastic or FRP for short. Like straw, the fiber gives the composite structure and strength, while a plastic polymer holds the fiber in place. In the case of fiberglass, hundreds of tiny glass fibers are bundled together and held rigidly by a plastic polymer resin. The most common example of an admixture is concrete. In this application, the structural steel rebar provides concrete strength and stiffness, while the cured cement rebar keeps it stable. Alone ripper will grow too much and cement alone will degrade easily. However, when creating a composite, a more rigid material is created.

If the procedure lasts a lengthy period, say 4 or 5 hours, the entire amount of anaesthetic cannot be provided in a single stroke. It might result in the death of an individual. If just a small dosage of anaesthetic is used, the individual could awaken in the process of the procedure.To avoid this, the anaesthetist gives the patient a few millilitres of anaesthetic every hour. Other complications may emerge if the anaesthetist fails to provide the anaesthetic to the patient within the specified time period. To prevent such dangerous difficulties, the construction of an anaesthetic machine's intelligent control depending on a microcomputer is beneficial. This system includes a controller and a needle injection device.By the use of multiple sensor findings, the anaesthetist may determine the level of anaesthetic in millilitres per hour to deliver to the individual. After getting the feedback from the detectors, the controller adjusts the signal to the desired level and feeds it into the electric motor, which drives the infusion pump properly. The anaesthetic is supplied to the patient in accordance with the rotation of the dc motor."

At the times of heavy rush, it often found that the shopkeeper searches for different sizes staplers which is time consuming and hectic also. So, in this invention we propose a two in one stapler where two staplers small and big size are combined together which eliminates the need of finding the different staplers and one can use the pin as per current requirement. Sometimes we are forced to use a particular pin which is in front of us or which is available at that moment, hence it becomes costlier process and also compromise with the quality of stapling."

        "title": "ENERGY MANAGEMENT CONTROLLER FOR DISTRIBUTING ELECTRICITY ACROSS THE MICRO GRID WITH INTEGRATED WIND AND SOLAR STORAGE BY USING DC AND AC BUSES",
        "abstract": "The direct current (DC) microgrids have gained more attention over alternating current (AC) microgrids due to the increasing use of DC power sources, energy storage systems and DC loads. However, efficient management of these microgrids and their seamless integration within smart and energy efficient buildings are required. This paper introduces an energy management strategy for a DC microgrid, which is composed of a photovoltaic module as the main source, an energy storage system (battery) and a critical DC load. The designed MG includes a DC-DC boost converter to allow the PV module to operate in MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) mode or in LPM (Limited Power Mode). Furthermore, the system uses a DC-DC bidirectional converter in order to interface the battery with the DC bus. The proposed control strategy manages the power flow among different components of the microgrid. It takes the battery lifetime into consideration by applying constraints to its charging/discharging currents and state-of-charge (SoC). The proposed system is simple and efficient in supplying DC loads, since as it’s not using complex algorithms either for MPPT or for energy management. The studied DC microgrid is designed and modeled using MATLAB or Simulink software. The load demand is satisfied while ensuring good performance and stability of the system. The controller design, analysis, and simulation validation results are presented and discussed under various operating modes. The purpose of the Energy Management System (EMS) is to ensure a high degree of efficiency, stability, and dependability. And the electrical system should have the ability to adjust to the majority of changes such as renewable energy integration. In some situations, the power generated by distributed power sources is greater than the local demand. This has an effect on the microgrid's stability and frequency. Smart energy management in a microgrid is proposed in this research., consisting of a wind power generator, photovoltaic and storage energy system for frequency regulation, and system balance. The above paper's main contribution is a system for managing energy. based on a clever strategy using MATLAB/Simulink. The results of the simulation and analyses demonstrate that the suggested microgrid energy management system is efficient at balancing energy."

Majority of the people like to travel in trains because it is affordable comfortable and fastest mode of transportation. In spite of large usage of railways, It is still not developed in technology in certain areas like level crossings. level crossing gates are still manually operated and many unmanned railway gates are present. Railway gates are mainly used to save the road users to prevent accidents from occurring. The information about appearance of train for opening or ending of door is entered from near station. But some road crossings are completely unmanned and numerous road accidents do at these unmanned position crossings. To avoid the mortal intervention at position crossings fully, we need to automate the process of road gate control In every level crossing there are so many of the railway accidents are occurring due to the carelessness and lack of experienced workers. The main objective of this invention is to control and operate the railway gate automatically and prevent accidents to save precious human lives. It helps to prevent accidents from occurring and reduce the manual labour. Here, we use Arduino and IR sensor.IR sensor use the IR transmitter to pass the arrival of train information, IR receiver receives the information and pass it to the micro controller. Arduino use the DC motor to close or open the gate. This invention is implemented using sensor technique. We placed the sensors at a certain distance from the gate detects the approaching train and accordingly controls the operation of the gate. Also an indicator light has been provided to alert the motorists about the approaching train."

In the last several years, the massive use of single phase power converters has increased the problems of power quality in electrical systems. High-frequency active PFC circuits are preferred for power factor correction. Any DC-DC converters can be used for this purpose, if a suitable control method is used to shape its input current or if it has inherent PFC properties. A new high-efficiency two-inductor boost converter is proposed in this project. The proposed converter has topology variation characteristic by an additional single-pole double-throw relay. By operating a two-phase interleaved boost converter at ac low line input and single-boost converter with two series-connected inductors at ac high line input, the proposed converter efficiently utilizes two inductors and switching components. The two-inductor boost converter operates as two-phase interleaved boost converter at ac low line input (90-140V AC) and as a single-boost converter with two series-connected inductors at ac high line input(165-265V AC), utilizing two inductors and switching components. Therefore, the proposed converter can be optimally designed and its efficiency can be maximized at the respective ac input range. The proposed converter can be the most attractive solution for high-efficiency power supply and other universal input power-factor-correction applications."

The active filter used here is DSTATCOM and the passive filter consists of inductor, capacitors. The rectifier circuit consists of diode which is used to convert ac to dc. The main disadvantage of this method is ageing of passive components ,uncontrolled filter currents ,cannot provide good power factor at large loads and also the value of passive filter is very high. Hence to overcome the disadvantages of existing method the proposed method is preferred. In proposed method the active and passive filters are connected in parallel so that harmonics are reduced and unity power factor is achieved. The parallel combination of a shunt-connected passive filter and a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) for a 12-pulse thyristor rectifier feeds a high-current variable-voltage electrolyzer load. With wide range of voltage and current, the reactive power consumed by the thyristor rectifier also varies enormously. The passive filter is able to provide only a fixed compensation hence the DSTATCOM is used to meet variable reactive power demand to keep the input power factor high even at partial load. To keep the DSTATCOM rating small, the bulk of reactive power is supplied by the dominant harmonic passive filter. Moreover, DSTATCOM does not provide any harmonic compensation, which is also taken care by the passive filter."

To enhance the efficiency of SPV array and hence the whole system regardless of the operating conditions, it becomes essential to operate SPV array at its maximum power point by means of a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. Various DC-DC converters have been already employed to accomplish this action of MPPT. Nevertheless, a LUO converter based MPPT is still unexplored in any kind of SPV array based applications. MPPT algorithm is used in this work in order to generate an optimum value of duty cycle for the IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) switch of LUO converter such that the Solar PV array is constrained to operate at its MPPT. Various configuration of LUO converters such as self-lift circuit, re-lift circuit, triple-lift circuit and quadruple-lift circuit using voltage-lift (VL) technique have been reported. Aforementioned topologies have high voltage transfer gain but at the cost of increased number of components and switching devices. Therefore, these topologies of LUO converter do not suit the proposed water pumping system."

Among the parameters of power quality are power supply reliability, voltage magnitude, frequency, symmetry, and waveform. Using parameters, one may evaluate power quality. Today, insufficient electrical service is a serious concern that may quickly pile up to a lot of financial hardship. Numerous studies have shown that power quality concerns such as sags, swells, harmonics, flickering, etc. cost the industrial sector a significant amount of money. As the number of electronic devices and renewable energy sources increases, more R&D is being invested in the improvement of electricity. \"Power quality\" relates to the condition of power between its generation and delivery to businesses, factories, and homes. Voltage problems account for at least fifty percent of all power quality problems. Most people agree that voltage sags, harmonic distortion, and unequal voltage are the three most important power system challenges. This is because these concerns impact utilities and the people who utilise them. The Dynamic Voltage Restorer, for example, has been proved to be the most effective and efficient technique to deal with power outages. Restoring the load voltage to its pre-sag value and smoothing it in fault and nonlinear load conditions has been demonstrated to be a highly effective application of the Fuzzy Neural Controller. It has proven useful in all circumstances for keeping harmonics within acceptable levels."

High-resolution transmission and scanning electron microscopy are both used in order to analyze the morphology of the material. The results of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provide light on the crystal structure and chemical makeup of LaFeO3 dendritic nanostructures. Characterizations of the structure suggest that LaFeO3 dendrites arise due to preferential growth in the [121] direction, which is caused by the directed attachment of LaFeO3 nanoparticles in the diffusion limit. Studies conducted using a microscope have shown that dendrites may develop with a length of 3–4 m, a branch diameter of 80 nm, and a length of 1–1.5 m. On the basis of experimental findings, a potential growth process for dendritic morphology is presented. This mechanism is examined from the perspective of both diffusion and orientated attachment. In addition, the electrochemical experiments that were carried out on dendritic nanostructures of LaFeO3 that had been deposited on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode revealed a significant impact that promoted activity. In the linear range of 8.2 x 10-8 to 1.6 x 10-7 M, the oxidation current is proportional to concentration, and the detection limit for this current is 62 nM when the signal-to-noise ratio is 3.

Majority of the people like to travel in trains because it is affordable comfortable and fastest mode of transportation. In spite of large usage of railways, It is still not developed in technology in certain areas like level crossings. level crossing gates are still manually operated and many unmanned railway gates are present. Railway gates are mainly used to save the road users to prevent accidents from occurring. The information about appearance of train for opening or ending of door is entered from near station. But some road crossings are completely unmanned and numerous road accidents do at these unmanned position crossings. To avoid the mortal intervention at position crossings fully, we need to automate the process of road gate control In every level crossing there are so many of the railway accidents are occurring due to the carelessness and lack of experienced workers. The main objective of this invention is to control and operate the railway gate automatically and prevent accidents to save precious human lives. It helps to prevent accidents from occurring and reduce the manual labour. Here, we use Arduino and IR sensor.IR sensor use the IR transmitter to pass the arrival of train information, IR receiver receives the information and pass it to the micro controller. Arduino use the DC motor to close or open the gate. This invention is implemented using sensor technique. We placed the sensors at a certain distance from the gate detects the approaching train and accordingly controls the operation of the gate.

One of the significant advantages of multilevel configuration is the harmonic reduction in the output waveform without increasing switching frequency or decreasing the inverter power output. This multilevel inverter produces a 15-level staircase waveform with 10 switches from single voltage source. In this configuration all switches operates with fundamental frequency with low switching losses. This multilevel inverter produces higher output voltage level near to sine wave with less harmonic content. As the number of levels reach infinity, the output THD approaches zero. The number of the achievable voltage levels, however, is limited by voltage unbalance problems, voltage clamping requirement, circuit layout, and packaging constraints. The proposed topology is used to synthesis the output voltage with minimizes error with respected to the reference voltage. This multilevel inverter which has been proposed is used for large electric drives. Simulation and experimental results shows that the switches are operating at the fundamental frequency. These converters have low output voltage THD, high efficiency and power factor. The converter has been adjusted to produce a 50 Hz, 15-level staircase waveform."

Throughout the charging process, the input current operates with a power factor of one. Conduction losses are drastically reduced by the removal of the DBR and current conduction due to fewer devices. The overall performance of proposed system is shown by means of various modes of operation, simulation and experimental process. EV batteries are typically charged in constant current or voltage mode, which increases the charger’s overall efficiency. The fly-back converter controls the charging in constant current (CC) and constant voltage charging (CV) modes. Both the converters are designed to operate in discontinuous mode (DCM), which eliminates the need for the input current sensor and inherent zero current switching for the converter is achieved."

The main objective of controlling the liquid level in coupled tank system is to minimize settling time. Conventional PID type controllers are being still widely used in level control systems. But to improve the system performance and achieve better time domain performance specifications, a novel intelligent FOFPI controller has been proposed which results in an enhanced performance than conventional PID controller. The invented FOFPI controller combines the effect of fractional-order PI (FOPI) control with self-tuning fuzzy logic to obtain an effective controller. Therefore, a proposed intelligent (FOFPI) controller is claimed to show the better performance in case of coupled tank system."

The Applicant's current invention further takes use of increased mesh technology, which decreases the overall weight burden of the bag and makes it more readily transportable. The Applicant's current invention is a carrying bag, more specifically a carrying bag with two loops or longitudinal threads called warps woven onto the bag instead of one. The two lengthwise warps are knitted/woven such that the GSM (Grams per Square Meter) of the entire fabric remains constant, imparting strength and longevity to the bag while keeping the weight and cost relatively low. This unusual substitution of single warp fabric for double warp fabric significantly improves the bag's strength and longevity. Bags made of single warp fabric break down after a few months of typical wear and tear, however bags made of double warp fabric last longer and may be used to transport larger things. The strength and durability of the bag may therefore be improved while the weight and cost of the overall bag remain same. In addition, the bag would be made from mesh cloth. Mesh is a knitted structure of fibers that is technically a barrier made of interwoven strands. The yarns are knitted or woven together to create a fabric with free areas between the yarn strands. The Applicant's current invention employs improved mesh technology, which enhances the durability and strength of the cloth employed."

Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors offer a number of benefits, including reduced maintenance requirements, high levels of efficacy, and high levels of reliability. The brushless direct current (BLDC) motor is widely utilised in servo systems as well as low power drive systems due to the benefits it offers. In the most recent decade, a variety of controller approaches have been utilised for the purpose of controlling the speed of a brushless DC motor as well as the ripple in its torque. In this application, a PIC microcontroller with MOSFET switching is employed. In addition, the parameter is adjusted with the assistance of Bat Algorithm (BA), and the performance is improved with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT). The use of zeta convertors, which allow for variable speeds in BLDC motors, is the focus of this work. A three-phase inverter operating in the 1200 mode of conduction supplies the BLDC motor with its three-phase input. It is the job of the zeta convertor to change the DC voltage that is fed into the three phase inverter. This causes the output voltage of the three phase inverter to also change, which in turn changes the speed of the BLDC motor. By manipulating zeta's duty cycle with dspic30f, it is possible to adjust the magnitude of zeta's output voltage. The zeta convertor is designed to function in a mode known as discontinuous inductor current due to the manner in which it was constructed."

The proposed intelligent controller applied in irrigation has controlled dripping to the plants at the required intervals and in required area rather than watering weeds. This application helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain the landscape, and expose the disturbed soil in arid areas and during periods below average rainfall. In spite of existing methodologies like dripping, sprinklers, subsurface etc., intelligent sensor based automatic machine learning method without the intervention of manual operation is applied only to the required field area which does not exist. The intelligent controller sensors placed in certain field areas monitors the temperature and moisture details required for training and test data for deep learning process. Irrigation in crop production has other uses including frost protection, suppression of weed growth in grain fields and prevention of soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies solely on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or arid land farming. The proper irrigation management of lands in arid areas are complex due to the low annual rainfall. Here an agro deep learning intelligent controller is proposed to ensure the crop growth and rationalize agricultural management. This agro deep learning algorithm focus on irrigation that has the potential to prevent potential drought, i.e. increase and stabilize the production of field crops, improve quality and actively introduce more profitable crops such as fruits and vegetables. In arid areas, it is difficult to achieve sustainable crop production without irrigation. Since this innovation model with intelligent deep learning process in regions with high levels of solar radiation, irrigation dramatically increases agricultural productivity."

Automation is used by doctors, hospitals, patients and researchers to reduce expenses and improve the quality of care, as well as to aid in the analysis of patient and operational data. Automation, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are all well-suited to deal with large amounts of data and automating repetitive processes. The healthcare system is complicated, with numerous steps and reams of paperwork. Patients must make appointments, complete registration forms, and attend doctor visits. The existing custom digital patient engagement tool automates appointment scheduling, allowing patients to avoid excessive wait times, and making procedures more efficient and effective. Also sending text messages to patients to remind them of forthcoming appointments is a common example of healthcare automation. To one step ahead, a novel idea of Web based frame work model is proposed which is a simplified health prediction method based on the input of the patients conditions registered in the automated module designed with fuzzy logic basis. Prior to admission in hospitals for any disease, the patients with their abnormal metabolisms and symptoms of any disease (for example, Bone based disease) can record for identification of their disease in the preliminary level. The outcome of this novelty is to identify the different initial bone based disease without the physician interference. As many patients are aware of the complications occurring in their body conditions for any type of disease and search in google for the causes and treatment. Also this automated health predictions system routes to the nearest hospital with name of the specialist based on their disease symptoms entered. The fuzzy logic controller used in this method specifies the disease vulnerability in terms of intermediate values from 0 to 1."

In fact, the sector contributes 18% to the country’s GDP. However, the agricultural sector needs proper irrigation facilities and other amenities to reap proper benefits. The major constraint in this sector is farmers’ dependency on pumps for irrigation. Most of the farmers use pumps some of which are connected to the grid while some pumps run on diesel and other fossil fuels. Another issue in this sector is related to the plight of farmers. Since some of the crops are seasonal, most of the farmers are deprived of regular source of income. Furthermore, farmers are not being able to earn anything from their dry/uncultivated land. Solar energy can be put to good use to address these critical issues of the agriculture sector. Solar energy is one of the most vital renewable sources of energy that can be utilized for various purposes. Solar energy is widely being adopted in residential, commercial and industrial sectors and it has huge potential to benefit the agriculture sector. So, with an endeavour to water security to farmers, this proposal formulated the design of cost effective solar pumps. The solar photovoltaic based agricultural water pumping system is best suited technology for irrigation of farms and the generation of electrical power is mainly dependent on solar irradiations. The soil moisture level, temperature are sensed and water is pumped according to the environmental constraints. In this proposal, efficient and optimal design of converter is designed and implemented with the BLDC motor based water pumping system. Proposed system is made closed loop by using multi sensors and farmer can operate the pump with his mobile itself according to the needs. The outcomes of this proposal is to create socio-economic impact on Indian agricultural sector."

This proposed work focuses on Multiport Converter for integrated hybrid energy system. In conventional methods, each source interfaces to the power bus via its own converter which increases size, complexity and volume of the system. While paralleling converters, we face serious problems like: 1. Difficulty in operating PV at maximum power point (MPP) and 2. Difficulty in injecting sinusoidal current into grid, which reduces reliability of the system. Multiport converter is used extensively in many places where two different networks need to be connected. It has two impedance networks connected via coupled inductor. The two networks can operate at two different frequencies based on that power sharing happens and output is generated. So it finds it application in hybrid renewable sources like solar, wind, fuel cell, etc., It has many advantages since it eliminates the circulating current which is present while cascading networks. Also it helps to overcome the current and voltage stress by power sharing method. It equally distributes the power between the components. The proposed converter eliminates the use of electrolytic capacitors and dc link and also there is no need for current sensor and output filter inductor which increases the reliability.

So, Quality of Service (QoS) is one of the important elements in IoT system which can be used for evaluation of performance and quality of IoT systems. The security breach in IoT have a great impact on the performance of IoT system. So, it is essential to evaluate the QoS parameters of IoT applications. MQTT is an ideal protocol in IoT as it is easy to implement, requires less battery power and small bandwidth. So, we have focused on secure transmission of data through MQTT as well as evaluated the QoS parameters for MQTT communication in IoT and detected the security breach by using neural network. We have used the two way authentication in MQTT. It provides more robust and secured data transmission scheme. In application layer, we have applied the encryption with device ID authentication so that it provides additional authentication for sending the data from sender to receiver in secure environment. [501] If still any mis-activity happened, then the system itself diagnose it within very less time and with high accuracy and shows that activity by using designed neural network. We have evaluated the multiple QoS parameters related to performance as well as security of MQTT communication in IoT. We have evaluated Delay, Data Loss, Authentication, Unauthorized data published, Device authorization, Packet loss and Packet delivery ratio. We have evaluated all these parameters by using a single system which is developed on the basis of novel neural network. The neural network is designed in such a way that it gives maximum accuracy for the classification of the attack in industrial IoT environment. Moreover, system gives suggestion so that machine itself can take the necessary action. The system provides suggestions like changing security key, changing device ID, etc."

        "abstract": "Power conversion, especially DC-DC conversion is a major requirement in various industries. The main drawbacks of classical DC-DC converters include high number of components, complexity and larger input current ripple which result in increased electromagnetic interference (EMI). Luo Converter can be used for this conversion, because it satisfies larger output range, high power density, low inrush current etc. Furthermore, interleave technique can be implemented to achieve other benefits which include reduced device stress and lower output capacitance. Similarly, Super Lift Luo converter is becoming very popular in the DC-DC conversion processes due to high voltage gain, and simple circuitry. Interleaved super lift Luo converter is a newly developed advanced DC-DC converter which is a combination of switched-capacitor function along with interleaved boost conversion. The use of more than one switch makes the control complex and less efficient. Hence, a Single Switch Interleaved Super Lift Luo Converter is proposed to make the control simpler, more efficient and more effective. This proposed converter works in continuous conduction mode operation. A MATLAB based simulation model of the proposed converter is developed to verify its performance. The proposed converter delivers high voltage gain without utilizing transformer or excessive duty cycle and features ripple-free input current which results in lower conduction losses and decreased EMI. Lower output capacitance is another advantage of proposed converter, leading to smaller size and lower cost. Furthermore, lower voltage stress on the switch allows the utilization of switch with low resistance."

Automatic Railway crossing employs IoT devices to manage the whole circuit. Two DC motors are acquainted to open and close the railway crossing gates, controlled by IoT devices. The primary objective is to bring-down the railway crossing gates when the train is on track and at 5-8 kilometers distant. IoT devices will block vehicles or people crossing the railway track by shutting the gate. IoTs device allow entry of vehicles/ people if the Green signal is ON and block the entry if the signal buzzes Red. Note that our invention has a control system for tracks, pedestrian path and roads. It automatically turns off the railway crossing gate when train arrives and shuts after train departure and it is mechanized through the calculation of train’s speed. Additionally, telecommunication firms that will send alert message to their mobile telephone customers at the gates regarding arrival time of trains. To sum it all up, our invention deals with automatic railway gate control at intersection replacing the gates operated by the gatekeepers. By employing the automated railway gate control at the crossing, the arrival of the train can be precisely detected by the sensors placed at the sides of track. Hence the gate closure could be at more accurate instant. Our invention aims to solve the problems like traffic congestion and unforeseen accidents at the gates. We set forth our idea to the Indian Government, in which junction gates could be controlled automatically. Modernization of Indian Railways had always been a primal focus (a major goal) towards the development of the essential infrastructure of India. We hope that our idea could be a tiny, yet significant contribution towards modernization of Indian Railways."

Although many SIDO Converters are existing, most of them are suffering from high voltage stress. This SIDO-TLC converter benefits from both three level and multiport structures. It is an integration of three level buck and boost converters whose output voltages are regulated simultaneously. Owing to the converter’s three level structure, the voltage stress across the semiconductor device is only half as much as the boost output voltages. There by reduction in voltage stress across semiconductor devices, improvements in efficiency are main merits of this converter. The main disadvantage of this SIDO converter is that it has more number of components. In order to overcome this demerit a new SIDO DC-DC converter with Electric vehicle is designed. The topology is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK of version R2014. It is observed that the efficiency of the converter is 92%. The converter is controlled using PIC16F877a controller. Experimental results obtained from a 5W converter prototype confirm the theoretical considerations and the simulation results of microcontroller."

The computing device also includes circuitry that enables the physical interface between the BMC and the processor in response to receiving a unique signal sequence from a trusted external entity. When firmware should be installed on the BMC, someone with proper authorization can cause the trusted external entity to send the unique signal sequence to the circuitry on the computing device, thereby enabling the physical interface between the BMC and the processor. The processor can then write the firmware to non-volatile memory within the BMC across the physical interface."

Everything can be linked through the Internet of Things by employing various sorts of sensors built for various purposes. The paper's major goal is to propose a system that allows streetlights to be automated and data from the lights to be transmitted over the internet. The lights in this smart street light system can be turned on and off automatically based on the weather conditions. To sense the external conditions, a light-dependent sensor as well as a humidity and temperature sensor are used. If the light intensity in the environment falls below or goes over a certain temperature, the street light system would automatically turn on and off. The humidity and temperature sensors are used to measure the temperature and humidity of the environment so that the roadway colour can be altered to improve visibility in certain weather situations. An artificial power source, such as solar panels, can be used to power the entire system. The installation of a wireless system to remotely control and track the energy usage of streetlights is proposed by the Smart Street Light System. This aids in the implementation of appropriate measures and the reduction of energy consumption using power conditioning and control. ON the light pole, the system must be mounted. A Microcontroller, multiple sensors, and a wireless module make up the system. The controller on the pole detects the object as well as the temperature in the area and adjusts the intensity of the LEDs accordingly. Both manually and automatically, the Smart System can be used. The control system automatically turns the streetlights on and off at the right times, changing the intensity as needed.

The key to combat these climatic changes lies in the uses of renewable sources of energy. Solar energy is one such example of renewable source of energy. Though the demand of solar energy is at its peak but the method used for generation of power from it is not up to the mark and has several snags. This paper helps to overcome some of the drawbacks of generating power through solar energy in a more convenient way. In this paper we have exhibited a circuit in which the DC power would be converted into AC in stepped up form. This circuit contradicts the in used method of power transformation which would require several intermediate steps and a transformer, thus making it to be more economical and simpler way of power generation. In this project the inverter that is used is advanced form of H-bridge inverter made of four MOSFETs. The triggering of these MOSFETs is controlled by pulse generator and a NOT gate. The voltage is stepped up by the help of capacitor and then fed to the grid through auto synchronizer so that the frequency can be maintained as per the IE rule."

Every day, millions of people travel from one place to another through trains. When train passes several railway junctions, the cross-gates are open and closed by the rail-worker (an employee of ministry of railway). Many-a-times, we still see unmanned crossing in our country, which are frequently prone to train fatalities. In general, railway gates are opened or closed manually by a gate keeper. The information about arrival of train for opening or closing of door is received from nearby station. Since past few decades, catastrophes were encountered at the gates because of incomplete information received by the gate-keeper from nearby station. In our invention, we have tried to push the envelope towards Internet of Things (IoTs), a sensing device for Automatic Railway crossing. Automatic Railway crossing employs IoT devices to manage the whole circuit. Two DC motors are acquainted to open and close the railway crossing gates, controlled by IoT devices. The primary objective is to bring-down the railway crossing gates when the train is on track and at 5-8 kilometres distant. IoT devices will block vehicles or people crossing the railway track by shutting the gate. IoTs device allow entry of vehicles/ people if the Green signal is ON and block the entry if the signal buzzes Red. Note that our invention has a control system for tracks, pedestrian path and roads. It automatically turns off the railway crossing gate when train arrives and shuts after train departure and it is mechanised through the calculation of train’s speed. Additionally, telecommunication firms that will send alert message to their mobile telephone customers at the gates regarding arrival time of trains."

This Scarecrow decreases crop damage by dispersing birds in a safe and human way. The main aim of the project was to design and construct a bird repellent prototype that is dynamic and play sounds of distress to disperse off the birds. Two wireless communicating devices being controlled by an Raspberry PI were developed with the help of RF modules consisting of sound producing system, rotating system and a motion sensor which were used as inputs to the microcontrollers when motion is detected, and the servo motors and the buzzer are activated. When the system design was powered the servo motors rotated, and a sound of distress was produced after motion detection. In conclusion, the technology of this modern scarecrow has many applications which include reducing financial loss due to crop damage caused by birds, reliable, human and safe agricultural bird dispersal, and the chosen bird control system for farming-industry."

Considering latest commonly used generator, it consists of multiple poles with no enough amount of winding space available for the copper wires to be wound on it (Comparatively less in this case). Basic knowledge suggests that more the number of turns in the conductor more will be the power generated when a magnetic field cuts it at maximum attainable rotational velocity. This generator will be termed as a double acting single-phase generator (DASPG). The propose generator provides a bigger space for conductors to be wound around and also provides a structure that can connect multiple of them in a row. Another unique thing about this generator is that it provides a free moving multi-directional axis for the magnets to rotate on one axis and revolve on the central axis respectively, so as to provide a sudden push/punch of energy/magnetic flux in the iron core and results in amplitude spike hence giving an output of higher voltages at a lower rotor rpm."

SPBO is are volulionary fast-converging algorithm that has been applied to a wide range of applications. To our knowledge, the SPBO meta heuristic method has never been employed in this sector. The proposed study tackles two distinct issues: the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)and aircraft pitch angle control. The study employs 15-20 normal benchmark functions and 10-15 CEC2020/202I routines for FOPID controller components. Because SPBO has a greater convergence rate, we will depict the result in terms of mean convergence rate and convergence graph, mean value, median value, standard deviation, wilcoxon and t-test. The proposed hybrid method is characterised by great performance and speed when addressing various optimization tasks. It is really obvious, both in terms of definition and execution. Ona variety of well-known test-optimization challenges, the approach was put to the test. On output indices like ISE, 1AE, 1TAI7., overshoot, settling lime, and rise time, the suggested method surpasses any of the more recent algorithms in this domain."

As the problem of urban traffic congestion intensifies, there is a pressing need for optimizing the traffic flow using computer vision is getting popular in recent days. Compared to a regular traffic signal which is based on timer methodology, usage of computer vision to regulate the traffic flow would really be a good idea to consider.The current methods used such as timers or human control are proved to be inferior to alleviate this crisis. In this invention, a system to propose an optimized solution for regulating traffic using Soft Computing techniques. The system detects the traffic density and switches the signal automatically based on the traffic parameters. The system is made to save time and avoid unwanted waiting in traffic signals. We have used a modified YOLO algorithm for detecting the vehicles which increase the accuracy in identification and localization of vehicles in the image. The pre-trained model is used to increase the efficiency and reduce the loss. This model uses regional prediction with the confidence level that denotes the certainty of the vehicle in the frame and hence it is faster than Haar cascade in predicting the objects in motion. The classification and segmentation accuracy are greatly increased by applying CNN to a full image and predicting the bounding boxes and probability for each region. Thus image classification using CNN and image localization using YOLO can be combined together to estimate real time traffic flow in both dense and free-flow conditions. The system was developed using the TensorFlow backend with a working platform as Google Colab."

        "abstract": "In present scenario life has become very fast and everybody wants to automate his daily working to avoid tensions and get himself busy in some other productive work. For example if we take up a process of boiling of milk in kitchen, it is a daily routine and a simple work, but due to busy schedule the person boiling the milk normally forgets to switch off the burner on time, when the milk has boiled, which results in spill , choking of burners etc. In Indian scenario problem is more complicated by traditional process of boiling milk. For example generally multiple boils of milk are done (2-3). In some cases of traditional cooking, the food item needs to boil for certain amount of time. Please note that intensity of gas flame also varies. For example boil for 2 min on high flame, then on 10 min on low flame and then turn off the flame. All these aspect require a boiling controller which monitors the boiling and adjust the flame intensity as per the instructions programmed in the controller. This invention proposes a system with a non-contact liquid sensor (e.g. VEGAPULS 6x). The VEGAPULS sensor emits short radar wave pulses in the direction of the medium. The surface of the medium reflects the radar waves which are then received back by the antenna system of the radar sensor. Finally, the instrument calculates the level from the running time of the radar signals. This effectively allow sensor to measure the level of medium (liquid here). So initially sensor records the level. Overflow level can be programed in the controller. Simultaneously controller will keep track of time since start. Time elapsed will be compared against boiling time and action take accordingly i.e. to lower the flame or turn off the flame."

This serves as a Learning board. The board could be used as Crosswords and Ludo. The Ludo focuses on the speed of solving a problem rather than playing a game with the throw of a dice. We have all the characters printed on the lids / caps to be fitted into the board that helps in the game of Crosswords. Apart from these, the toy elements like the cartoon characters could be part of the pack and fitted in the board which gives a totally different feel to the child learning mathematics and vocabulary. We could incorporate customized characters in the game as well. The board is an interconvertible board wherein the board could be used either as Learning board or as Crosswords or as a Ludo game. The product could serve as a chess board as well. The applications could be further developed using this concept of inter-convertibility and based on size and shape of the board. There are more than one board in a given pack, numerous characters, different shapes and sizes and these boards are attachable and detachable from each other. These could be just simple boards, could be an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based setup, remote control operated, semi-automated or automated to navigate through the entire learning process or gaming experience.

Because of their blessings like clean nature, pollution free, cost free the utilization of them are increasing in life style. The key drawback of such renewable distributed generation is associated with unintentional islanding development. Islanding will causes in the distributed generation due to unintentional opening of main grid. Islanding will causes dangerous conditions to equipments and apparatus connected with it. Thus, it is needed that as per IEEE 1547 and UL 1741 standards within 2 seconds we have to detect the islanding. In a new hybrid islanding detection method is presented with low frequency current harmonic injection and over/ under frequency relay for inverter based distributed generation. A low frequency current harmonic is injected into the system through the q controller of the grid side controller. The injected low frequency current component causes the system frequency to deviate during islanding. It evaluates the performance of this hybrid ROCOF relay when load and generation are matched and successfully detecting the islanding and also clearly differentiates between islanding and non islanding events for mixed types of RDGs connected to the grid. The test system results, are carried out in MAT LAB/Simulink environment shows the strength of this method."

As the battery state-of-charge (SOC) increases, the controller automatically switches from constant current (CC) control mode to constant voltage (CV) control mode, seamlessly with phase shift control technique as per the requirements of EV battery charger. At the same time, the resonant converter's soft switching condition is maintained at all load conditions by frequency control over a narrow range to achieve reduced EMI and higher efficiency towards enhanced reliability. To meet the recommended practice of IEEE Std 141-1993, the unity power factor is maintained using a Dead-Beat Current control method. Both, the control-tasks of the Power Factor Correction (PFC) and battery charging are embedded onto the single reconfigurable and reprogrammable FPGA platform to achieve higher synergy in control of both the converters used for EV battery-chargers. This increases reliability of the control hardware, reduces latency and exhibits high speed of operation, thus suitable for all real-time applications."

        "abstract": "Air separation is currently one of the most important gas operations in the chemical industry . It is performed typically at large-scale by cryogenic distillation to produce high-purity product streams. Adsorption processes have the potential to substitute the energy- and capital-intensive distillation operations with the right adsorbent and process technology for several applications. Currently, commercial adsorption technologies of different production scales, i.e., PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption ) & VPSA (Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption ), exist to realize this separation to generate oxygen-rich streams as well as nitrogen-rich streams, which are useful in a variety of industries Traditionally, adsorption-based air separation employs materials that selectively adsorb nitrogen in order to recover high-purity oxygen as light-product, e.g., commercial zeolites. Nitrogen-rich product streams may also be generated by applying carbon molecular sieves (CMS), modifying cycle configuration & process operating conditions . Face mask is fitted in low power vacuum pump with electrostatic filter placed at distance from face mask to facilitate effortless respiration with healthy air devoid of dust, Bacteria and viruses in pulsating mode in coordination of respiratory cycle of individual . It is more important in view of current Covid 19 situation to provide healthy air free of corona virus to all. In the proposed design Dust filter position changed from pre compressor to base of Gas separation chamber the dust filter is kept on metallic frame work to withstand the weight of overlying zeolite powder. Instead of two cylinders and one compressor ,in this patent one cylinder and two compressors used in one cycle .One ultra high vacuum pump having high Air flow capacity placed at the other end of system near oxygen cylinder. Other Vacuum pump or Liquid jet vacuum pump with low capability placed before cylinder to regenerate zeolite after saturation with nitrogen towards beginning of regeneration phase of cycle .Unequal timing ratio of adsorption and regeneration ranging from 1/4th to 1/20th adsorption to regeneration time in each cycle. In this design different location of valves in comparison to conventional PSA system are proposed. Deep fridge used to separate water vapours ,Carbon di oxide gas and other low boiling point constituents of air to provide highest purity of oxygen. For industrial applications deep fridge up to -200 degree Celsius temperature to separate nitrogen, argon oxygen and other rare gases from liquefied air to get more profit in such competitive environment. At the base of cylinder design is improved from conical to flat with multiple air inlets to increase the speed of oxygen production .In desorption/regeneration phase of cycle dust cleaning made feasible along with exit of nitrogen. Even Horizontal laying of cylinder containing zeolite may also be employed along with Vibrating of zeolite containing cylinder with vibrator in horizontal and vertical modes. Without oxygen generator with electrostatic filter One submersible pump having week vacuum capacity will be sued between dusty filter and face mask .Dust filter will remove dust, Bacteria and viruses from air and shall provide clean and healthy air comfortable to user Single cylinder cycle Adsorption phase After start of Vacuum cum Booster pump in this system ,Middle valve will be kept in closed position while bottom and top valve will be in open position . High vacuum will be created which will start air flow from Air inlet . Air reaches in cylinder through dust filter present over the metallic support . Air is passed through Zeolite powder to selectively adsorb Nitrogen simultaneously Oxygen is passed through top of cylinder and reaches at the inlet of vacuum pump . The outlet of vacuum pump is connected to the inlet of Oxygen cylinder. This Adsorption phase remains on for 20 seconds. Regeneration Phase After completion of Adsorption phase ,the regeneration phase starts for three seconds duration. During this phase Bottom valve and Top valve are closed and middle valve is in open position to facilitate flush out of nitrogen under vacuum instead of zero pressure utilised in PSA and VPSA systems into environment or collection into separate cylinder of nitrogen collection cylinders. Vibrating system at bottom aids in Maximum adsorption of nitrogen and flushing out of nitrogen in regeneration phase there by causing return of zeolite in original state to make them available for next cycle . These two phase go on sequentially which constitute one complete cycle This technology not only ensures the highest oxygen purity, but also decreases the need to frequently replace sieve beds, reducing the overall cost of ownership. Vacuum is the most efficient way to desorb nitrogen from sieve material while delivering the highest purity of oxygen. This vacuum adsorption process leaves sieve material as good as it can possibly be at the start of each sieve bed cycle. No wasted oxygen and More energy efficient."

Also, the eco-neutral pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrigen (NOx) and unburnt hydrocarbons (UHC) are also increasing. This calls for innovative research in non-conventional fuels to replace fossil fuels. Hydrogen is one such fuel which has an exceptional combustion property and appears to be proving itself as the best transportation fuel of the future. On the other hand, compressed natural gas (CNG) has already been credited as a remarkable fuel for its better emission characteristics and has been implemented as a transportation fuel in metros. Therefore, the use of hydrogen blended with natural gas seems to be a viable alternative to pure fossil fuels because of the expected reduction of the total pollutants and increase of efficiency."

It helps the common people to enjoy the convenience, flexibility and freedom to do all banking transaction. The machines can enable customers to withdraw cash at more convenient times and places than during banking hours at branches. Today Customers use different (many) cards to withdraw the money, i.e., debit and credit of money. The invention is also use only single card for credit and debit both and this idea helps the card holders to use single physical card for debit/credit card facility thereby avoiding the necessity to carry multiple card. The invention is to a single card system makes the deposit and withdrawal from any bank any ATM without giving any additional charge. Insert the card into the machine then the machine asks for the phone number from customer (for verify or authenticity of user and increasing security) that has registered with the bank. Once the customer enters the mobile number, the OTP (One Time Password) will come in customer’s phone (registered/ verified number). If the OTP is valid then screen will display to withdraw the money from debit card or from credit card and to check the saving account otherwise, the transaction ends. After entering the correct OTP customer enter the amount if customer wants to withdraw the money, the control systems checks the available balance and process the transaction if possible (assuming the system does not let the balance to become negative). The invention is an if the transaction is impossible, an error message is displayed and the system prompts to enter another transaction from another bank account. For example, customer may have required money in some other bank, but by mistake or he/she want to withdraw money from different bank, in this case error will be shown like “Request cannot be proceeding” and will suggest customer to select some other bank and make the similar request. At any time when prompted to enter a transaction, the user may cancel, at which point the ATM machine will close the session and eject the card. Finally, ATM machine prints the receipt and ejects the card."

Ring oscillator is a widely used circuit in the present RF electronic systems, in which the parasitic components within the MOSFETs are utilized for deciding upon the period of the output frequency. However, with the present VLSI technologies, the conventional expressions are not quite accurate in obtaining the output frequency. This is because, the MOSFET dimensions are shrinking with newer processes, and hence, the estimate of parasitics is not possible with the usage of the first order design equations. The second order design equations are too complex for the designers to put into use. Therefore, a novel mathematic expression is obtained in our particular work, in which the ring oscillator is modelled by means of the switching behaviour of the MOSFETs. The expression obtained is suitable to be utilized for any process technology, for any device dimensions, and for any number of stages in the single-ended ring oscillator. This expression helps the electronic engineers to arrive at a faster design of the oscillator, avoiding the larger hand calculations as well as the number of simulations."

The microgrid operates mainly in three modes, namely, grid-connected mode (GCM), standalone mode (SAM) and the diesel-generator mode (DGM). The GCM of microgrid active only when the main grid is present in the system. In the GCM, the voltage source converter (VSC) of the microgrid operates in the current controlled mode (CCM). The failure of the grid results in the operation of the microgrid in the remaining modes. The SAM has activated only during the failure of the main grid occurs, where the power generated by the solar PV array is excess than the load demand or the battery can discharge its power to meet the load demand. The VSC of the microgrid operates in voltage-controlled mode (VCM) in this mode of operation. The DGM of microgrid happens only when the main grid is not available, where the power output from the solar PV array is lower or nil than the load demand and the SOC of the BES is lower such that it is not possible to provide power for a longer duration. Thus the DG set is synchronized into the microgrid only during the emergency situation and thereby, the economic operation of the conventional diesel energy source is performed. In this mode, the VSC operates in the CCM. Thus the microgrid provides continuous supply to the loads without causing any power interruption; hence, it is very suitable for powering the critical loads. The power quality improvements such as compensation of harmonics, reactive power and load unbalance are achieved by using a new adaptive filter (AF) control algorithm. The compensation of the neutral current is done with the help of a zig-zag transformer connected at the load end."

        "abstract": "Invention Title: Compact, portable, hybrid & cost-effective semi-fast / fast DC charger solution for EVs based on utilization of single or multiple 1-Ph or 3-Ph AC Level-2 charging points simultaneously.  Development of ecosystem for quick adoption of electric vehicles in India require technological innovations due to many constraints in electric mobility technology at present. Some of the key issues are charging time of the EV batteries, high cost & unavailability of adequate charging infrastructure and grid augmentation constraints. There is a strong need of out of the box and practical innovative solutions to enable quick migration of fossil fuel based mobility segment to electrical vehicle based ecosystem in India. As per ISGF (India Smart Grid Forum) study report on “Electric Vehicle Policies and Electricity Tariff for EV Charging in India” published in July 2019, present scenario & constraints for development of EV charging infrastructure for different type of EVs are briefly summarised here. Heavy Four (4) wheelers i.e., bus etc. with extra-large battery capacities are very costly equipments and are not recommended to be charged from public charging station. Hence, electric buses will be supplied with proprietary battery chargers to be installed stand-alone by bus operators. Two (2) Wheelers with small battery capacity are adequate for home & public charging through normal 5A/15A wall socket. Three (3) wheelers with medium range battery capacities are also suitable for home & public charging as well as are ideal candidate for battery swapping. Four (4) wheeler electric cars with high battery capacities are the most suitable candidates having major requirement regarding development of public EV charging infrastructure. Presently, electric car battery charging typically takes 8-12 hours through normal 15A socket at home and battery swapping is not recommended/technically feasible for electric cars. Public/commercial fast charging infrastructure is quite inadequate in India at present stage due to cost, implementation & grid augmentation constraints. Hence, higher battery charging time & non-feasibility of battery swapping facility for electric cars along with unavailability/high cost of fast charging infrastructure and high initial cost of the EV are major constraints for quick & large scale EV based mobility adoption in India. Presently, electric cars manufactured/offered in India have typical battery capacities ranging from 10KWh-40KWh. These cars are offered with slow AC charging & fast DC charging options. For slow AC charging, an on board charger typically of 3.3 KW (or 7.2KW in very few make/models of electric cars) rating is provided along with charging cable. This is typical level-2 slow AC charging system provided with all type of EVs as a basic facility which takes 8-12 hours full charging time. Option of DC fast charging is provided along with slow AC charging option. However, installation cost of such DC fast chargers (typically having rating of 50KW & above) requires huge CAPEX (typically initial cost of approximately INR 20 lakhs or above) due to its conventional design, requirement of wide & flexible range of voltage & current output, CAN bus control requirement for EV charging from third party DC charger, communication facility with DISCOM, other unwanted/additional high end features/functionalities and is economically unviable option for smaller entrepreneurs/entities intending to provide EV charging services and hence not suitable for quick adoption of public EV charging infrastructure in Indian environment.  Hence, a solution is proposed to achieve fast & semi-fast DC charging of the EV using multiple available idle 1-Ph & 3-Ph AC based chargers at particular location which will enable electric car owners to quick charge their car almost at any public/private location having multiple 1-Ph AC charging stations in adjacent or single 3-Ph AC charging station without the requirement of sophisticated, high end, complex & costly DC fast chargers. The proposed solution will able to take care of anxiety of electric car range & unavailability of the adequate EV charging infrastructure to the great extent with expected maximum charging power delivery up to 14.4KW in case of availability of more than one 1-Ph AC points and up to 21.6KW in case of availability of single 3-Ph AC charging station. The proposed solution will effectively address the major issues & constraints development of fast public charging network for EVs and will enable quick adoption of EVs in market to realize faster migration to EV based ecosystem in India."

        "abstract": "A Buck Boost converter is a step up and step-down DC to DC converter. It is a switched mode power supply that uses a switch, inductor and a capacitor. Therefore, the average voltage across the load can be either greater or lesser than the input voltage, which is determined by the duty cycle of the pulse provided to the MOSFET. Inductor is used to smoothen the load current and capacitor is used to reduce the ripple of the output voltage. Speed of a dc motor can be varied by varying flux, armature resistance or applied voltage. Speed control can be achieved by variable battery tapping, variable supply voltage, resistors or electronic controls. Generally, to control the stepless velocity and smoothness, adjustment of the armature voltage of the motor is used. Applying PWM signals with respect to the motor input voltage is one of the methods most employed to drive a dc motor. The hard-switching strategy causes an unsatisfactory dynamic behavior, producing abrupt variations in the voltage and current of the motor. These problems can be addressed by using dc/dc converters, which allow the smooth start of a dc motor by applying the required voltage. DC/DC power converter has two energy storing elements [L&C], which generate smooth dc voltages and currents with a small current ripple, reducing the noisy shape caused by the hard switching of the PWM controller. Here the converter topology uses soft switching technique to reduce the switching losses which is found prominently in conventional buck boost converter; thus efficiency of the system is improved and the heating of MOSFET due to switching losses is reduced and also the MOSFETs have longer life."

This is a time-consuming process, manual error prone system and raises the accident probability eventually. This present invention evaluates and demonstrates the applicability of IoT to resolve the problem of unmanned automatic railway crossing. Framework is proposed that uses IOT sensors near the railway gate, not only detects the arrival of the train but able to detect the obstacle on track near the gate with Machine Learning (ML) approach of object detection. Whenever a train touches the base of the sensor, alert signals get activated at the railway crossing, to aware the general population about the arrival of the train and closing of the railway gate. After this warning, the control module initiates and shuts down the gates on both side of the track. Once the train crosses, the module lifts the gate according to the received signals. For mechanical operation of the gate dc adapted engines are utilized. The proposed prototype makes use of an installed controller whose working revolves around the 8051 family (at89c52) for the control. As per the instructions produced at the microcontroller, the appropriate action (i.e., shut or lift) is made. This logic is implemented in embedded c and dumped to the Arduino board. The prototype successfully shuts the gate at the time of train arrival and lifts the gate as the train departs from the other end.

One blade is stationary while the other blade is movable which can be swinged away from the stationary blade by pulling/pushing the handle upwards/downwards with one hand. The blades were chamfered to improve its penetration into the coconut husk. The handle was made of combination of two hollow M.S. pipes. A square pipe of 20 mm side with 80 mm length was welded with M-12 size nut at one end to enable easy connection and dismantling. A Cross bar enables attachment of handle to either sides of to operate combination coconut dehusker by both left and right handed operator with choice to utilize either pulling or pushing strength. Safety cap covers the wedge blades of the machine and thus it prevents injuries due to accidents. The coconut is impaled with both hands on the blades (in juxtaposed position). The coconut is held stable on the blades by one hand while other hand is used to pull/push the handle. As the handle is pulled/pushed the movable blade get separated from the stationary blade and a small portion of the coconut husk is removed from the coconut."

Automated controlled incubator instrumentation system for the preparation of dahi has been developed to minimize the human interventions, consequently improving the microbial quality. The pH control is better in terms of effective process control and assures of best product quality and is far more superior to the simple time control. Whey-off in set-curd is the main culprit of its poor texture, increased sourness, reduced shelf-life, smell and taste, which occurs mainly due to the shaking and mechanical disturbances or vibrations to the pot in which curd is set. To control whey-off in curd, it is required to incubate and store the dahi containers/cups at the same place, so that the causes of mechanical disturbances could be eliminated completely in shifting the set curd from incubation chamber, maintained at about 42 °C to the storage cabinet, maintained at about 40C. In this automated endo-exo unit the optimum temperature is provided by the developed new automated controlled mechanism, instead of changing the place of dahi-cups after setting the curd. In the developed endo-exo cooling unit/cabinet, instead of two separate units, one for incubation and second for cooling storage; there is only one unit, which serves both the purposes at the same place without disturbing and shaking the set curd/ product simultaneously reducing the production cost. Optimization of temperature, pH, incubation period, cooling temperature and other parameters based on the number of dahi cups placed can be achieved in the developed automated endo-exo unit within 4-5 trials."

Several Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices are used by utilities to meet the in growing demand in a fast-increasing power system network. One of the best Flexible AC transmission System (FACTS) is Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). As it gets more benefit from both real and reactive power transfer, it is used in power system for controlling the transmitted power. The UPFC controls the power on the transmission side of the power system. When the real as well as reactive power is set the UPFC tries to follow the command by using the Proportional and Integral (PI) controller. But in some power systems the PI controllers cannot produce the proper power due to the power oscillations. In this work, the PI controller is aided with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) adapt PI controller (PSO-PI). It shrinks the power oscillations by using the objective function.

The proposed single-switch DC-DC converter offers ultra-high voltage gain at comparatively low duty cycles. The reverse recovery issues of diodes and failure rate of power switches are eliminated due to the low duty cycle operation. All the semiconductor devices of the proposed converter are exposed to very voltage stress which reduces the losses, power rating and overall cost of the components as well as of the system. This converter utilizes extendable LCL network and extendable SC network for gain extension. Incorporation of these gain extension networks make this converter modular in nature. Hence, the converter circuit can be extended based on the voltage gain requirement. Finally, the implementation of control algorithms are very easy due to the only one power switch in the circuit of the converter. The 250W/380V hardware prototype of the converter yields a voltage gain of 19 times at a duty cycle of 60% only during testing."
